Synopsis: Toron notices you speaking with the strabge ox, but he's not too concerned, just curious.

Toron: Huh. Funny.

Session Sequence: PAD_Cyanide -> Cyanide -> AD_Busy ->  -> AD -> Bird -> AD_TadpoledStart -> HealedBird -> PAD_TadpoleResearch -> AD_TadpoledCombat -> AD_WithBird -> AD_Studying -> LockedUp
----- Session: PAD_Cyanide -----
Synopsis: Context: Nettie has given the player a vial of poison to take if they start turning into mind flayers. Players reflect on whether they should actually take it if the time comes.Speaker 1 has just promised Nettie they will take the poison if they begin to turn. (SPEAK TO JORDI, The Speaker 1 nodes may need to be changed. )Speaker 2 reacts to Speaker 1 acquiring the poison after swearing to Nettie they'll use it if they start to turn.Gale - Shadowheart: We'll resort to poison if necessary.Lae'zel - Astarion - Wyll - Karlach: It won't come to that - don't entertain the option.

Player: Wyvern poison. Let's hope it doesn't come to that.
Player: Better a quick draught than ceremorphosis, nonetheless.
Player: Better to have on hand than not.

----- Session: Cyanide -----
Synopsis: Nettie leads the player into a lab and fetches a thorn. The player doesn't know, but the thorn is a deadly poison. Nettie knows it's the only choice she has - the player could transform into a monster and kill everyone in the camp. She sees this as a kindness - the transformation is terrible - so she has a very 'matter of fact nurse' tone about the whole thing before she scratches you, but will get stressed if you resist. Once she's scratched the player, her tone will be softer - kinder. She plans to sit with you while you pass and make it as easy as possible. The player will have to convince her they're not a threat if they're going to get the antidote. She'll be slow to convince, hesitant to allow any risk to the camp. Nettie is STANDING for this entire dialog.

----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Nettie is the apprentice of Halsin, the missing druid. We can tell her about the parasite in our heads. She listens with compassion but decides the player is too dangerous and must be quarantined. If she knows about the parasite, she'll invite the player to come with her deeper into her rooms for "treatement."

Nettie: First you save us from goblins, then you bring Kagha back from the brink. You're making your mark. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Examining injured bird. Glances up from her work to look at player.NodeContext: Examining injured bird. Glances up from her work to look at player.
Nettie: Give me a moment. I'll be right with you. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Looks back to the injured bird after glancing at the playerNodeContext: Looks back to the injured bird after glancing at the player

Nettie: Drow. Last time I saw one of you folk, he tried to slit me open. I hope you're more agreeable. || [context] NodeContext: Doesn't like drow, but she's willing to give you a chance.
Player: Where did you see another drow?
Nettie: That's neither here nor there. || [context] NodeContext: dismissive
Nettie: Look, you obviously want something. What is it?
Nettie: Now, what was it you needed? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Turns to the playerNodeContext: Turns to player
Player: I need help. Now.
Nettie: Just be glad my bedside manner's better than yours.
Nettie: Come here. Let's have a look at you. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Approaches the player to examine themNodeContext: Approaches the player to examine them
Nettie: You seem healthy enough. A bit tired 'round the eyes, maybe. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Examines the player, carefully looking them up and and down.NodeContext: Examines the player, carefully looking them up and and down.
Player: Right. Yes, I'm... very tired indeed.
Nettie: Then get some rest. There's no better magic. || [context] NodeContext: with care
Nettie: Take a nip of whiskey before bed if you need to. Come back to me if that doesn't do it.

----- Session: AD -----
Synopsis: This triggers as Nettie is at her desk in Halsin's lab, researching and organising. The bird she was treating may have died at this point.

Nettie: Halsin would have known what to do. Damn it all.

----- Session: Bird -----
Synopsis: This bird has been told to go and find Halsin and you're interupting him just as he's getting ready to take flight. He's tense and in a hurry to be gone, so he'll only answer one question before taking to the skies and carrying out his mission.

Tingmiaq: Not now. Places to be.
Player: What's the rush?
Tingmiaq: I have to find Halsin. There's not a moment to lose!

----- Session: HealedBird -----
Synopsis: The 'Wounded Bird' that Nettie was treating after some time has passed (after Goblin Hunt or Attack on Den). The bird's recovering and feels a bit better.

Wounded Bird: There was so much noise out there. I'm glad you're okay.

----- Session: PAD_TadpoleResearch -----
Synopsis: Player read Halsin's research on the mind flayer tadpole. The VB plays only if they didn't find Halsin already and didn't go through the tadpoled scene with Nettie (otherwise they got all that information from her so it's not a surprise).

Player: Looks like Halsin's our best bet for a cure.
Player: We need to find him, before it's too late.
Player: What if something happened to him?
Player: All the more reason to hurry.

----- Session: AD_TadpoledCombat -----
Synopsis: The player triggered combat during the tadpoled scene

Nettie: I don't want to hurt you - but I have to protect the others.

----- Session: AD_WithBird -----
Synopsis: Nettie is tending to a badly wounded bird. The bird is weak, its life hangs in the balance, but Nettie is doing what she can.

Nettie: They did a number on you, didn't they? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Hunched over the bird, moving hands over it.NodeContext: Sadly
Nettie: Does that hurt? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Hunched over the bird, moving hands over it.NodeContext: Gently, as if to a child
Wounded Bird: *Chirp!* || [context] NodeContext: Pained chirp
Nettie: I know. We're nearly done. || [context] NodeContext: Sympathetic

----- Session: AD_Studying -----
Synopsis: After poisoning the tadpoled player, Nettie settles down at her old Master's desk to see if she can uncover any secrets about the tadpole in his research.

Nettie: I'll see if there's anything in Master Halsin's notes.
Nettie: He didn't find a cure, but maybe we can make you comfortable.

----- Session: LockedUp -----
Synopsis: During the scene where she scratches you. Nettie is in the lab, sitting at a table, studiying Halsin's notes. The player can still try to persuade her to give the antidote. The player must also accept to take the wyvern poison. The other choice is to kill Nettie.

Nettie: And? Will you swear you'd die before you turn? || [context] InternalNodeContext: She doesn't have the wyvern poison in her inventory, player pickpocketed it already
Player: Fine, just give it to me.
Nettie: Swear it.

======== Scenario: den_adventurersquest ========
Session Sequence: RaidAdventurerAtCorpses -> RaidAdventurer -> LeaderAtCorpses -> AD_LeavingCorpses -> AD_AradinAndRemira -> AD_AdventurerCleaningWound
----- Session: RaidAdventurerAtCorpses -----
Synopsis: The adventurer is standing next to the corpses of her comrades she left behind while running for the goblins.

Remira: I told them to run, the idiots.
Remira: You better turn north here, or you'll end up like them.

----- Session: RaidAdventurer -----
Synopsis: Age: mid-30-40s.
Female
Bio: Rough and working-class. A veteran of many expeditions, Remira is nonetheless shaken after a raid gone horribly wrong and trying to hide it behind bravado. She feels guilty for leaving a new recruit to die, but tries to wave it away and gets defensive if confronted over it. She’s sarcastic and casually racist.

Remira: Ah, the fighting foulblood. Glad to know one of you has a spine. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: She cleans her wound, a cut on her arm with a [cleaning cloth]
Player: I already regret saving your life.
Remira: Ah - bruised your feelings, did I? Excuse me if I don't weep - got problems of my own. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Finishes cleaning wound and puts the [cleaning cloth] away.
Remira: My arm's near hanging off after wise Zevlor left us to die at the gate.
Remira: And then he has the bloody gall to try and blame it all on us.
Player: He let you in, didn't he? It could have been worse.
Remira: Oh, very gracious of you. || [context] NodeContext: You're trying to be gracious and she's not having any of it.
Remira: We expected a soft job. Something to test the new lad, maybe, but not a bloody goblin nest. || [context] NodeContext: She's justifying her actions - they'd taken on a job that seemed simple but quickly got out of hand. People died and she's doggedly maintaining that she's the victim. More explanatory than whiny, though.
Remira: Most would've turned tail at the sight. But not Liam, no - he charged them, the stupid bastard. || [context] NodeContext: She's genuinely hurt at the loss of this recruit but projecting a knowing persona to hide it, as if his bravery is somehow a rookie mistake. Note of incredulity rather than laughing at him, as if he did something very stupid.
Player: Leave.

----- Session: LeaderAtCorpses -----
Synopsis: Aradin comes across the corpses of some of his friends, who were lost during the goblin raid. He's in a neutral location at a bridge and observing the corpses of his people and of goblins, who were also killed in the fight.

Aradin: Thought you was busy with the foulbloods in Halsin's grove.

----- Session: AD_LeavingCorpses -----
Synopsis: After encountering some dead adventurers in the forest, Aradin urges his remaining company to keep moving (only plays if he's not alone).

Aradin: Come on. We're wasting time.

----- Session: AD_AradinAndRemira -----
Synopsis: Aradin and Remira are having a drink after arriving back in the Druid Grove.

Remira: You shouldn't have brought Liam along. Lad was too young.
Aradin: Everyone needs to cut their teeth sometime.
Remira: Cut his teeth?! For his sake, I hope he's dead already.

----- Session: AD_AdventurerCleaningWound -----
Synopsis: Remira is cleaning a wound she got from the goblins. She winces and grunts in pain while checking out the damage.

Remira: Wound looks clean. Small mercies.

======== Scenario: den_druidservant ========
Session Sequence: 005 -> AD_ChaseAwayBoar
----- Session: 005 -----
Synopsis: Arron is a friendly, but tired servant to the druids in the grove. Unless the player is a druid, he would rather they don't linger, though he is sympathetic and will help them any way he can (by selling them supplies). He is happy to see a druid and to help them. He can be a little preachy.

Arron: Another outsider? This place has certainly become popular. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Arron turns around and wipes his hands on his trousers (he was standing at a table, with his back to the player).
Arron: Well met, and thank you for beating back those goblins. Most brave of you.
Arron: Is there anything you need? Act fast if you do - the ritual will be complete before too long.
Player: What ritual are you talking about? || [context] InternalNodeContext: needs flag.
Arron: Ah - I forgot you're a blow-in. A few days hence, this grove will be completely concealed by thorny vines.
Arron: None will be able to enter - or leave.
Arron: A drastic measure. But more monsters seem to terrorise this region every day.
Player: What about the people here?
Arron: We druids will be safe. As for those that took refuge here... well, may Silvanus guard them as they continue their travels.
Player: Seems like most are tieflings. They'll be fine. They have devilish powers. || [approval] ['Astarion 1', 'Wyll -1', 'Karlach -1']
Arron: Ignorance is agony, my friend. I will include you in my prayers. I'd better get started - for your sake.

----- Session: AD_ChaseAwayBoar -----
Synopsis: |This AD plays when Tusk, a boar, interrupts a druid while she's participating in a long, intense ritual. Tusk is getting in the way.|

Apikusis: You're testing my patience, pig. || [context] NodeContext: She's trying to be kind, but she's annoyed
Tusk: *Grunt!*

======== Scenario: den_general ========
Session Sequence: TieflingGuard5 -> RefugeeChef -> AD_TieflingGuard1 -> PAD_ElevatorUnusable -> AD_TieflingGuard3_8 -> ElevatorBear -> TieflingGuard8 -> Gatekeeper -> TieflingGuard4 -> AD_CorpseMove -> VB_Grave_TieflingLeader -> AD_TieflingGuard10 -> PAD_ShadowheartBook -> PAD_BearStatue -> AD_Refugee1 -> Squirrel -> PAD_EntranceStatue -> GruntingKid_Hideout -> Refugee4 -> TieflingGuard11 -> AD_Adventurer02 -> VB_Grave_AdventurerLeader -> VB_Grave_Kanon -> AD_Gatekeeper -> Rat -> AD_TieflingGuard4 -> Tiefling001 -> TieflingGuard10 -> AD_TieflingGuard8 -> GraveDig -> AD_GruntingKid -> AD_Refugee4
----- Session: TieflingGuard5 -----
Synopsis: She drank a potion given to her by the hag, with the promise that it would make her strong as steel. It did, but it has paralysed her legs. The effects are temporary, but she's angry and embarassed at the situation she's found herself. She doesn't suspect any foul play on the hag's part. We get a clue about this mysterious old woman selling potions in the cave, and through tagged gameplay can reveal that she's been duped. She is frustrated at herself - she wanted to help in the goblin fight, and instead she is sprawled on the ground.

Pandirna: Did that...? No, damn it. Still nothing.
Pandirna: Maybe - maybe it just needs time to wear off. Fingers crossed the goblins don't return any time soon.

----- Session: RefugeeChef -----
Synopsis: An older woman, responsible for feeding an entire camp of refugees before they leave. She is gruff but has a heart of gold. She offers the player some gruel. Purpose is to highlight how desperate their situation is.

Okta: You. Saw you fighting those slimy bastards. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Bowl in hand, paused mid preperation of gruel. Next to a pot with a ladle in hand. Looking at the player, appears annoyed. NodeContext: Gruff sounding. Shouldn't be clear if you're annoyed at the player or not.
Okta: Fancy a bowl? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Holds the bowl out to the player. Nods towards it, doesn't expect to be refused. NodeContext: Gruff as you hand the food to the player. Doesn't expect the player to refuse.
Okta: Best to fill your belly now - while we still can. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Holding the bowl out. NodeContext: Warmth to her voice despite the gruff exterior. She's obviously concerned about the player but is hiding it.
Player: I'm not hungry.
Okta: Suit yourself, but the only way we'll make it to Baldur's Gate is to run, and run hard. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Shrug as Okta pulls the bowl back towards her. NodeContext: Player has turned down your food. You're annoyed but hiding it with indifference.
Okta: If a gnoll catches your scent, you'll need every bit of strength. Trust me. || [context] NodeContext: Ibid.

----- Session: AD_TieflingGuard1 -----
Synopsis: AD for a shelshocked tiefling patrolling the bridge and looking at the dead below. Older tiefling.

Rikka: More goblins. What's next? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: She's staring at the dead below.NodeContext: Shocked and scared.

----- Session: PAD_ElevatorUnusable -----
Synopsis: VB when the player clicks on the elevator, but it's blocked by the bear lying on top of it.

Player: Won't budge.

----- Session: AD_TieflingGuard3_8 -----
Synopsis: This occurs between Okta and Ikaron. Okta is the grumpy chef in the camp and Ikaron is her son, a surly but caring guard. The purpose of these is to highlight their relationship, and how both of them care deeply for the camp, even if they're not the best at expressing it.

Okta: You packed? || [context] NodeContext: Worried about her son but hiding it behind a gruff and sharp tone.
Ikaron: Yes. || [context] NodeContext: Mother is chiding him about preparing to leave. He knows it's just because she's worried and is trying not to sound exasperated.
Okta: Eaten enough? || [context] NodeContext: Sounding more worried and concerned.
Ikaron: Mother, I'm fine. || [context] NodeContext: Gently trying to reassure her without sounding annoyed.
Okta: I know... I know. || [context] NodeContext: Terrified for her son but trying to hide it.

----- Session: ElevatorBear -----
Synopsis: A bear is sleeping on the elevator, blocking it off from use. She's very tired and doesn't want to get up

Tuffet: Hmmm...? I'm... sleeping... || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The bear lifts up his head, sniffs the air and goes back to sleep.NodeContext: Mumbled - he's still half asleep and doesn't want to wake up. Can be said with a yawn, and have a snore after it.
Player: Could you move just a little bit? I need to use the elevator.
Tuffet: Uuurghh... okay. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The bear sluggishly gets up and moves.NodeContext: long groan, then she agrees to move - she's still very sleepy.

----- Session: TieflingGuard8 -----
Synopsis: A stoic guard. You're a stranger in his camp, and he warns you no to cause trouble. They've already lost a lot of people.

Ikaron: We've known enough grief this tenday, traveller.
Ikaron: Don't be the cause of more.

----- Session: Gatekeeper -----
Synopsis: Tiefling in charge of operating the gate at the druid's grove. She saw goblins attack and saw the player(s) help to repel them.

Session Sequence: Group -> Sister -> AD
----- Session: Group -----
Synopsis: Three people are having an argument. Rolan, Lia and Cal. Lia and Cal are brother and sister, but the three of them have grown up together. They're young, talented tieflings who are heading to Baldur's Gate to start their lives and careers. Rolan argues that they should leave now and get to the city while they still can. Lia argues that it is irresponsible to leave their kin behind. Cal is stuck in the middle.
This is a passionate and fiery argument, both sides are convinced that they are correct.

Lia: Hells, we can't just leave. They're kin. || [context] NodeContext: This is the start of the dialog but clearly an ongoing argument. You think it's your responsibility, as a tiefling, to stay and help your kin. You're angry, voice is level but will soon grow louder, and utterly convinced that staying at the camp is the right thing to do.
Rolan: I'll not gamble our lives, our futures, on people who are as good as dead. We must leave for Baldur's Gate - at once. || [context] NodeContext: You're angry but your voice is level. You think staying at the camp is essentially suicide. You cannot believe it was even suggested. You and your friends have brand new lives waiting for you in Baldur's Gate - to stay at the camp is reckless and pointless to you.
Cal: Can we all just take a moment? Please? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Looking for one to the other. Stuck in between them, pleading. Hands out as he tries to calm the situation. NodeContext: Your friend and sister are screaming at each other in front of you. Light and easygoing tone as you try to calm the argument.
Lia: What's the point in blades and spells if we don't bloody use them? We should stay. || [context] NodeContext: Your voice is getting louder. You're very angry now. It's your civic duty to use the skills you have to help people. You cannot believe how selfish Rolan is being.
Lia: These people aren't fighters. We can help. || [context] NodeContext: Ibid.
Cal: Or yell louder. That's fine too. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Sighing as he shrugs. He knows neither is listening to him. NodeContext: Your friend and sister have ignored your plea. You know once they've started they'll just keep arguing until one of them gives in. This is almost said with a shrug and in a light, jokey tone.
Player: You should all stay. A single blade could make a difference. || [approval] ['Gale 1', 'Karlach 1']
: False
Rolan: No. This place is a death trap. Let us leave - immediately! || [context] NodeContext: Player has disagreed with you. You're frustrated and angry. You think it's ludicrous that anyone would disagree with you.
Rolan: Or would you deny your brother here his chance at fortune in Baldur's Gate? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Looking at Lia but gesturing to Cal. NodeContext: You know the argument is likely going your way and you're being a little bit of a dick here. You know mentioning Lia's brother is a guarantee that she'll give in to your side and leave with you. It's a bit of an underhanded move.
Player: You want fortune? There's coin in it if you stay.
Lia: You know, that money could go towards a spiffy new outfit for your apprenticeship...? || [context] NodeContext: Smile, knowing rolan will give in
Rolan: Zurgan. Fine. Give it here. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Generic 'taking' animation. Taking coin from the player.NodeContext: 'ZUR-gan.' Frustrated but giving in to the promise of going.
Rolan: If we survive, it'll make for a good story I suppose... || [context] NodeContext: Kinda sulky but accepting that you'll stay in the grove.
Lia: Thank you, Rolan. And thank you, friend. || [context] NodeContext: Warm and sincere. Directed at rolan and then player.

----- Session: Sister -----
Synopsis: This occurs after the argument betwen Lia and Rolan. Lia is still stewing after the fight. Opportunity to get to know her better and understand the group dynamics.

Lia: Those goblins will rue the day they chose to tangle with this grove.
Lia: You and I will do some good here - I can feel it.

----- Session: AD -----
Synopsis: This occurs betwen Lia, Cal and Ronan. There are mixed ADs which occur - when they're arguing about when to stay and go, when they've decided to stay and when they've decided to go.

Cal: How long will it take to get to Baldur's Gate? || [context] NodeContext: Cheerful, you're glad the argument is over. Bantering with your family.
Rolan: Depends. How often are you going to ask that? || [context] NodeContext: A note of humour in your voice - very much a 'are we there yet, are we there yet' situation.
Cal: Hey, sis. How long will it take to get to Baldur's Gate? || [context] NodeContext: You know you're being annoying and you're enjoying yourself.
Lia: *Sigh.* || [context] NodeContext: A big dramatic sigh even as you're enjoying the banter,

Synopsis: In these dialogues, Zevlor reflects on what's happened (an attack of goblins at the gate, which the player helped with) and his mistrust of and bitterness towards the druids who are reluctantly hosting his people. He is exasperated, furious, but also eager to meet anyone who could help. In the same dialogue, we can also uncover that he is in fact a traitor, concerned only with getting these people through the goblins so he can trade them for his own safety later.

Player: I'll see what I can do.
Karlach: I knew I liked you.
Zevlor: We'd owe you a great debt. If we're forced to leave now, more of my people will die. || [context] NodeContext: Grateful
Zevlor: You'll find the druids at the heart of the grove. Please - make them see sense, before more lives are lost.
Zevlor: Oh, and if it's of any concern... you're brave to walk around without hiding your heritage. I'll make sure everyone knows that you helped us at the gate. || [context] NodeContext: Addressing an awkward topic before he forgets - most would run from your race on sight, but he's reassuring us that we're welcome

Session Sequence: PAD_SidedHag
----- Session: PAD_SidedHag -----
Synopsis: This VB plays after saving Ethel from the two brothers of the sister she's holding captive. Ether disappeared in a magic puff, and she was acting suspicious. The players are reacting to her exit and discussing that there may be more to Ethel than meets the eye.Speaker 1 may have been the character who was in dialog for the scene with Ethel. Speaker 2 is another party member. However, since there may be combat, this setup isn't guaranteed and it's best to write this assuming everyone had a hand in the actions that led to this VB playing.

Player: Bloody way to end an argument. I hope we chose the right side.
Player: No point in debating what's already done. Let's go on ahead.

Player: You protected a child-stealing vampire? Bold choice.
Player: Let's hope it doesn't come back to bite me later.

They want to save Mayrina but are overwhelmed and ill-equipped to deal with the situation. Player can accompany them or tell them that the player will handle it alone. The player can also abandon them to their fates.

Demir: Bloody hells, she just disappeared. Ain't seen nothing like that before. || [context] NodeContext: Opening line of the dialogue, The hag has vanished and your left terrified. This monster has your sister and the sheer magnitude of the situation is hitting you.
Johl: She could shoot fireworks out of her backside for all I care; the hag has Rina. || [context] NodeContext: Your brother is afraid of the hag and you're having none of it. The hag has your sister and you'd fight a thousand of those monsters to save Mayrina - you're pissed that your brother isn't the same.
Player: Will someone please tell me what's going on?
Demir: It's our sister - Mayrina. She is... well, she was in a bad way after her husband died. || [context] NodeContext: Your sister is heavily pregnant and has disappeared - likely to make a deal with a monster - in the hopes of bringing her husband back. Your voice is gentle as you discuss the trauma Mayrina has gone through - obvious that you love her and are worried about her.
Johl: Started saying weird things, like how she was gonna bring him back. || [context] NodeContext: Your sister is heavily pregnant and has disappeared - likely to make a deal with a monster - in the hopes of bringing her husband back. You're scared but are hiding it beneath anger and frustration.
Demir: Next thing, she's gone looking for the hag. Of all the stupid things to do. || [context] NodeContext: You're terrified for your sister and her child and are struggling to justify her reasons for disappearing. You think she's being foolish and naive.
Demir: We haven't seen her since, and no good ever came from dealing with a hag. || [context] NodeContext: Ibid.
Johl: None of this matters, all right? We need to get her back. And fast. || [context] NodeContext: Your brother keeps talking and you're getting more angry and scared. You need to leave and find your sister - you're terrified of what will happen if you don't.
Player: You're on your own. I have enough problems. || [approval] ['Astarion 1', "Lae'zel 1", 'Shadowheart 5', 'Wyll -1']
Johl: And we've no need of a mouthy bastard.
Johl: Come on, Demir. We'll make our own way.

Should we step back and do thing, she summons monsters to cut the two brothers down. Should we side with her, we have to kill the brothers. Should we side with the brothers, Ethel is angry and disappears with a threat.

: Lads, for the love of all that is holy, I've never clapped eyes on your poor sister. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Looking at the brothers - hasn't noticed the player yet. NodeContext: Opening line of the dialogue. Annoyed as you plead with the two men who advance on you. You sound sincere and genuine.
Johl: Drop the act, hag. You was the last to see Mayrina. || [context] NodeContext: Not buying Auntie Ethel's claim that she hasn't seen Mayrina. Accusation and fury in your voice - you're prepared to get violent if needs be.
Demir: Just let her go. Please. || [context] NodeContext: Your brother is on the brink of violence and you're trying to regain control of the situation. You just want your baby sister back, you don't want anyone to get hurt.
: You there! Please, I don't know what's come over these boys. I just want to go home. || [context] NodeContext: You've caught sight of the player.

He's pleasant, cheerful, and a little eccentric - but shows his experience and expertise when warning us about the hag. He's affable and unassuming, but shows moments of steel when discussing his quarry (Astarion). A younger General Iroh from Avatar is a good reference - someone who makes you feel good about yourself just by conversing with you.

Gandrel: Ah, a fellow wanderer. Forgive the aroma. || [context] NodeContext: Friendly - noticing a stranger, wryly apologising for the slight stench
Narrator: *You catch a waft of something foul - metallic and sickly-sweet.*
Gandrel: Powdered iron-vine. Most monsters will think twice before making a meal of me. || [context] NodeContext: Explaining the smell in the air - he's taken a foul substance designed to ward off monsters
Gandrel: An old hunter's trick - if you can't mask your scent, spoil it. || [context] NodeContext: Friendly, unassuming, as if what he's saying is perfectly conventional
Player: Who are you?
Gandrel: Today? The same as you - a humble supplicant, come to bargain with the lady of this house.
Gandrel: A sharp wit will serve you better, if you're to bargain with the lady of this house.
Gandrel: That is why you come to her lair, I take it? To bargain? || [context] NodeContext: Gently prodding for our story
Player: My business here is my own.
Gandrel: As you like. But you needn't be coy - whatever's worth knowing, rest assured she already knows it. || [context] NodeContext: Nodding, not fazed by our secrecy though he thinks it unnecessary
Gandrel: Her kind have hidden among us since the first darkness - and their knowledge is matched only by their spite. || [context] NodeContext: Growing slightly grave - telling us of a great evil thing that is not to be underestimated
Gandrel: Know how to ask, and they'll share that knowledge. If you're fool enough to pay their price. || [context] NodeContext: Telling us the risk might be worth the reward - but is is a great risk
Player: And are you fool enough?
Gandrel: Of course. I'm a hunter who lost his prey, and here I am seeking help from something worse. || [context] NodeContext: Amused and absolutely accepting of his own foolishness
Gandrel: But she thrives on suffering. Once she hears what awaits my quarry when I catch him, she will help. || [context] NodeContext: Growing grave
Player: I'd like to trade.

Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: The scrying eye is a floating eye that acts as a sort of magical security camera. This one is hovering around the goblin camp spying on players and broadcasting back to Moonrise Towers. The presence watching is a drow at moonrise.

Narrator: *The eye's glassy black surface reflects your gaze.* || [context] NodeContext: the 'eye' is large, magical and floating around watching you
: True
Narrator: *As you gaze deeper, you feel a focus. An intent.* || [context] NodeContext: this 'intent' is unnerving
Player: Reach out to the presence.
Narrator: *You feel a brief, lurching connection. The sensation of falling into your own image, endlessly.* || [context] NodeContext: unnerving
Narrator: *Confusion. Alarm. Then the presence withdraws - leaving a dull black mirror once more.* || [context] NodeContext: urgency and mystery - the 'dull black mirror' is the surface of the crying eye

Session Sequence: 
======== Scenario: gob_raidercunning ========
Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Non crit-path. This goblin is recounting stories of her last raid and displaying a wound. It's less a cause of pain than a subject for boasting.

Sharp-Eye Nass: Seen this mess? Flamin' Fist thuggo took a chunk outta me arm last raid out. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: She's holding her arm up to playerNodeContext: Speaks to the player slightly more as an equal - they've been accepted into the camp thus far, after all. She's displaying a nasty wound
Player: You fought Flaming Fist?
Sharp-Eye Nass: That last inn we 'it. They were guardin' some uppity noble 'n his friends. || [context] NodeContext: Almost bored at the story - she's describing an incident of great significance to you but she only cares about the fight and the spoils it brings
Sharp-Eye Nass: Not very well, mind. Yer drow pals carried him off, left the real spoils to us. || [context] NodeContext: Snorting, derisive. Both of the mercenaries who couldn't put up a fight, and of the fact that the drow only cared about taking hostages, leave the real valuables (in her eyes) behind

======== Scenario: gob_quartermasterflimsy ========
Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: A trader from the Zhentarim (z-HENT-ah-rim) , a shady organisation of spies, assassins and dealers in illicit goods. The player may or may not recognise her as such, but either way her attitude is blunt, breezy and unscrupulous. She's there to make money, and you're either there to make a deal or wasting her time - she has absolutely no interest in indecision or moralizing.

Roah Moonglow: That the jingle of coin I hear? You've timed it well, my friend. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Custom CamNodeContext: Warm and welcoming (a kind of mercantile 'Who do we have here?')
Roah Moonglow: Already turned quite the profit today, so I'm feeling generous. || [context] NodeContext: Trying to coax you into a deal
: True
Narrator: *You recognise the crest she bears - the winged serpent of the Zhentarim.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Camera should show Crest of Zhentarim she is wearing
Player: What business does someone like you have in a goblin camp?
Roah Moonglow: You joking? Goblins sell the best prisoners - cheap, quiet, and eager to be elsewhere. || [context] NodeContext: You've made the assumption that there's nothing worth trading with goblins - she's the expert correcting you. As if giving tips to a novice
Roah Moonglow: Till this crowd converted and started sending their captives to Moonrise Towers, at least. || [context] NodeContext: Correcting herself. Tone is rueful - some of her best trading partners have fallen to organised religion.
Roah Moonglow: No complaints, mind - I just sold enough smokepowder to cover the loss ten times over. || [context] NodeContext: Perking up - she still managed to make a profit. Always a bright side.
Player: What do you know about Moonrise Towers?
Roah Moonglow: All I need to - there's an awful lot of folk flowing that way, and coin is sure to follow. || [context] NodeContext: She doesn't share your curiosity - but she sees the opportunity for business in Moonrise.
Roah Moonglow: Might have to find my faith and see this Absolute for myself, eh? || [context] NodeContext: Speculative, joking - she'll happily pretend to be relgious if it means making a deal
Roah Moonglow: Still some deals to be done here, though - you want to trade, or what? || [context] NodeContext: Eyeing you up, bringing you back to the topic at hand
Roah Moonglow: Now - much obliged for the chat, but I'm here to trade. || [context] NodeContext: Insincere about the chat - she's just Impatient to get back to the matter at hand.
Player: Leave.

======== Scenario: gob_nerdygoblinsage ========
Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: He is smarter than your average goblin, and is reading a manuscript - loose papers, freshly written by Volo. It's a study of goblin behaviour that would give anyone who reads it an advantage in combat against goblins.

Booyahg Piddle: Huh? What do you want? I'm tryin' to concentrate on readin'! || [context] NodeContext: pleased with himself
Player: Can I see the manuscript?
Booyahg Piddle: I ain't finished with it! There's enough readin' here to last me a lifetime. || [context] NodeContext: indignant
Narrator: *A strange symbol glows, marked on their flesh, and something within you stirs in response.*
Player: It'll be a very short lifetime if you don't hand me the manuscript.
: True
Booyahg Piddle: Bloody hell - an' people say goblins are savage. || [context] NodeContext: upset, afraid - we're bullying him || [approval] ['Gale 1', 'Shadowheart 1']
Booyahg Piddle: It ain't worth fightin' over. Take it! || [context] NodeContext: upset afraid, we're bullying him

======== Scenario: gob_drowcommander ========
Session Sequence: Dead
----- Session: Dead -----

----- Session: Tome -----
Synopsis: The player finds a book on necromancy - from one of the Red Wizards of Thay. Once read, the book will be bound to whoever tried to read it. Some origins will demand you let them read it, while others will want the book burned. If you read the book, you'll hear strange, distant whispers. The more you read, the stronger the voices will become, and the greater the chance that you'll be driven mad.

Narrator: *The book radiates power, but the words you read in the Codex echo in your mind, guiding your eyes safely across the page.*
Narrator: *The once-indecipherable glyphs now feel dangerously familiar, promising unholy power to those who can take it.*
Player: Read on and wrest the book's power from it.
: True
Narrator: *As you parse the strange glyphs, you can feel the book resisting. Ghostly voices whisper at you from the dark - probing and fighting your mind.*
Narrator: *But your will is iron and you brush past these shades of the past, devouring every secret the book has to offer.*
Narrator: *You see now, life and death are malleable as clay, to be bent and reshaped by your will. By your power.*
Narrator: *But as you close the book, a nagging doubt whispers in your mind. What consequences will there be for calling the dead from their rest?*

----- Session: PAD_PlayerTriedToTakeTome -----
Synopsis: Plays if the player tries to take DangerousBook (The Necromancy of Thay) out of their companion's inventory when the book is bound to that companion (and therefore locked to their inventory). The PAD will play and the tome won't be removed. Only valid for Astarion, Gale, who want to keep the book and won't let anyone take it from them.

Player: Sorry, but that book is spoken for - by me.<br>

Session Sequence: 
======== Scenario: for_owlbear ========
Session Sequence: VB_CubResolution_2P ->  -> PAD_KilledByGoblins -> VB_EggPickedUp

Synopsis: The party briefly reflects on their decision to spare or kill an orphaned owlbear cub.

Player: At least the cub has a fighting chance now. || [context] NodeContext: Reasoning; justifying decision to let an orphaned animal cub live.
Player: That, or we've just prolonged its misery. || [context] NodeContext: Unconvinced. Wondering if it would've been better to kill the animal.

----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: In SwA, the owlbear speaks like a human. Her voice is deep and threatening - the voice of a seasoned fighter, at home in a fight and used to winning. However, she knows she's injured and at a disadvantage, but refuses to betray that to the player. Doing so might encourage the player to attack, putting her cub in danger.The player stumbles upon the nest of an owlbear; a large, predatory hybrid creature. They find themselves in a stand-off against the beast - if they get too close or act aggressively, it attacks. If they keep cool and back off when the opportunity presents itself, the owlbear will let them leave. The player may also notice that the owlbear is wounded - a broken spear protrudes from one eye socket. They may notice that the owlbear has a cub - this is the main reason for her aggression and territoriality.Additional note 1: the player may stumble upon this scenario by themselves, or they may have been pointed in the right direction after meeting some cultists who had a close encounter with the owlbear. If we won these cultists over, they may be available to fight the owlbear at our side.Additional note 2: If the owlbear mother is killed but her cub survives, we can decide the juvenile's fate. If we spare it, we may later find it being used for sport by the goblins in their camp.

Narrator: *You feel the quake of its heavy footsteps before you see it: an owlbear, its beaked face looming out of the darkness.* || [context] InternalNodeContext: This greeting if the player doesn't have Speak with Animals.
Owlbear: *Growl.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Ready to pounce.
Player: Study the owlbear's behaviour.
: True
Narrator: *The owlbear's one good eye flicks away for a moment. You follow its glance...* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The owlbear glances over
Narrator: *...and see an owlbear cub.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Cub is highlighted.
Player: Back away slowly.
Narrator: *As you retreat, the owlbear lets out a short huff. The message is clear...*
Narrator: *...You can leave now, or step closer and die.* || [approval] ['Gale 1', "Lae'zel -1", 'Shadowheart 1', 'Karlach 1']

----- Session: DwarvenAlchemist -----
Synopsis: Derryth is a dwarven alchemist visiting the underdark from Baldur's Gate. She runs a shop in the city with Baelen, her business partner. They've come to the underdark in search of a very valuable mushroom - noblestalk. When the player arrived, she was tending to an injured gnome.
Derryth is a bit gruff - she's a healer, but her bedside manner leaves a lot to be desired. She's also a very shrewd businessperson. She's in the underdark to get rich first and foremost.
She treats her business partner (Baelen) like he's an idiot, and pretends not to care about him, but in reality he is the most important person to her in the world.

Derryth Bonecloak: Seems the 'shrooms are letting in more people every day. || [context] NodeContext: Not friendly. She's got a real squint in her eye taking you in.
Derryth Bonecloak: You see a fella on his own on your way in? Dwarf. Baelen's his name.

Player: Need some help finding him? || [approval] ['Wyll 1', 'Karlach 1']

Narrator: *The creature's song rumbles within you, neither warm nor welcoming.*

----- Session: VB_GlutDead_1P -----
Synopsis: Players refuse to kill Sovereign Spawn on Sovereign Glut's behalf. Glut has attacked the players and is now dead. The party comments afterwards.

Player: The usurper is dead. So much for 'Circle Glut'.

----- Session: CheckpointGuard_000 -----
Synopsis: You come upon the myconid guards. They warn the sovereign of your presence telepathically, and it begins to speak to you. This should be creepy, hallucinatory.

Narrator: *You are swallowed by a chorus of turbulent music. Through one creature sing many voices: the harmony of an entire collective.*
Restless Myconid: ((*Sovereign. they have come. they are here*))
Narrator: *The choir fades. A single melody rises above the others, brassy and commanding.*
: ((*I am Sovereign*))
Narrator: *You see a vision: your lifeless body, wrapped in fungal tendrils. The sovereign is threatening you.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Player closes eyes as if seeing the vision in their head.

----- Session: DeepRothe -----
Synopsis: A Deep Rothe that belongs to Derryth and Baelen Bonecloak. A beast of burden with a simple Speak with Animals dialogue. There's some reactivity depending on whether Baelen has returned to the bonecloak camp or not, and if Baelen recovered his senses by eating the noblestalk mushroom. The animal's observations reinforce that Baelen has been more amiable and gentle since his mind began to slip, and his recovery is not seen as a good thing by all.

Deep Rothé: Master sounds different, like old self. Angry self. Don't like. || [context] NodeContext: SWA line. Reproachful. A simple beast of burden senses his master has returned to a crueler demeanour.

Blurg: I must complete this study. Entertain yourself elsewhere.

----- Session: SocietyOfBrilliance_MindFlayer -----
Synopsis: Omeluum is a friendly, neutral mind flayer and member of the Society of Brilliance, dedicated to improving life in the Underdark. If attacked, it will teleport away rather than engaging in combat.

Omeluum: I greet you, friend of the dark.
Omeluum: I greet you, sun child.
Player: How do you survive? Don't you need... brains?
Omeluum: In the beginning, I had an arrangement with a lich. Excellent company, despite what one would expect.
Omeluum: I required brains, he required souls. A perfect symbiosis.
Omeluum: But our ambitions eventually splintered. I wished to better the world, and he preferred its rot.
Omeluum: So I left his company, and thus I now feed from those who... act against the Society's goals.
Player: Best way to deal with that sort of hunger, I suppose.
Omeluum: Perhaps the peoples of the Underdark will be less inclined to violence if they comprehend the cost, yes?
Omeluum: I greet you, sun child.
Player: I'd like to learn more about the tadpole.<br> || [approval] ['Karlach 1']
Narrator: *An almost childlike joy enters Omeluum's ichor-laced eyes.*
Omeluum: Open your mind to me, friend. Let us see what lurks within.
Player: Never mind. I'm done with mind flayers touching me.
Omeluum: I see. I will remain here if you decide otherwise.

----- Session: DirectToSovereign -----
Synopsis: If you speak to a myconid after the guards speak to you but you have not yet spoken to the sovereign, his voice will speak through them.

Narrator: *Fungus and mould glaze the grotesque creature's face and body.*
Narrator: *A voice drifts into your mind as you gaze upon the misshapen servant.*
: ((*leave this one. come to me. we must speak*))

----- Session: BroodingSovereign -----
Synopsis: A sovereign myconid we call the brooding sovereign has been displaced to this myconid circle, after the duergar attackes his home. He would like to join you as you cleanse the area of duergar as a means of getting revenge - supposedly.

 The top block: The borroding myconid is with the other myconids. You can recruit it.

The middle block: You have killed the lone duergar. the myconid now wants you to kill all the duergars.

 Next block: you have killed all the duergars; now it wants you to kill the sovereign
. 
Final block: you have killed the sovereign and it rewards you. 

This myconid does not speak with the same hive mind voice of the others. He should sound creepy, like FART in Rick and Morty, with a SLIGHT undercurrent of menace.

 As the quest moves on, he gets more and more creepy and angry,

Sovereign Glut: ((*the tumour is excised. the duergar are dead*))
Sovereign Glut: ((*here, I break ground. from the dark will a mighty Circle rise. my song will fill the Grotto!*))
Sovereign Glut: ((*death-doer - the Grotto may sustain but one Sovereign. in the Age of Glut...*))
Sovereign Glut: ((*...there may be no Spaw. eliminate the other Sovereign*))
Player: If you're so eager for blood, Glut, then let me give it to you. || [approval] ['Astarion 1', "Lae'zel 1", 'Wyll 1']
Sovereign Glut: ((*you shall never again know home*))

----- Session: InjuredGnome -----
Synopsis: STATE NODES - first half of dialogue, Thulla is in EXTREME pain, speaking in short, terse sentences.Second half - she's weary but recovering.Thulla is a member of the Ironhand Gnomes, a group of militant gnomish artificers who came to the Underdark to find a forbidden - and extremely secret - formula for runepowder: an explosive of awesome power.Thulla is a true believer in the cause - when her group was captured by duergar, she escaped but picked up a poisoned wound on the way. She's slowly succumbing to poison - initially vague and feverish. If we heal her, she's exhausted but straight back on task, giving us the job of freeing her people.

Thulla: Argh...I'm coming along. Just not fast enough. Any word on my people? || [context] NodeContext: Gasping at ache. Frustrated she's not healing quicker.
Player: Remind me - what do I need to do?
Thulla: Like I said, save my kin. And if you kill any duergar, you won't see tears from me. || [context] NodeContext: Reiterating what she wants us to do. On the mend.

Thanks!]

Lae'zel: Kith'rak. We must speak!

----- Session: PAD_Shield -----
Synopsis: Comment on acquiring or moving a shield of a Flaming Fist mercenary killed by the dragon on the bridge.

----- Session: CINE_RiderAndDragonLeave -----
Synopsis: Cinematic: Kith'rak Voss flies away on his dragon.The player interrupted the Gith Chokepoint situation.

[desc] CinematicNodeContext: ~The dragon spreads its wings and soars away.
NOTE: this could be used in a number of circumstances in which Voss flies away. Voss is an arrogant senior gith officer, focused on his mission, so he can always depart while being unfazed by preceeding events. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: ~The dragon spreads its wings and soars away.

----- Session: Flind -----
Synopsis: The flind is the leader of a pack of gnolls. Normally, these monsters hunger for flesh and eat anything, but the flind has been infected with a mind flayer's tadpole (like the players) and this has created an internal 'Voice' that guides it toward certain meat, forbidding others. The forbidden meats are those that work for the mind flayers - including the players - leading to a telepathic 'dialogue' when the flind restrains itself from attacking and calls off its pack.

We can attempt to overpower the Flind psionically, allowing us to control it temporarily in order to destroy the pack of gnolls. If we choose to fight the Flind, we should be prepared for a difficult encounter. It is strong, though far from the most powerful of its kind thanks to the war raging in its brain.
