Zevlor: Find me in the caves. I need to let people know we're moving. || [context] InternalNodeContext: Player clicks on Zevlor while he is getting back to his default position in the cave after the confrontation.
When Zevlor finally reaches the cave, his dialog is switched to DEN_TieflingLeader

----- Session: PAD_ZevlorsMap -----
Synopsis: |Player clicked on Zevlor's map (a map of Elturgard that shows the road to Baldur's Gate). Zevlor will likely have drawn on it.|

Player: Looks like we're in Elturgard. Some distance from the city of Baldur's Gate. || [context] NodeContext: Karlach, grumbling about being so far from BG
Player: Gnolls and goblins marked on the map. Travel won't be easy.

----- Session: DenIntro -----
Synopsis: In these dialogues, Zevlor reflects on what's happened (an attack of goblins at the gate, which the player helped with) and his mistrust of and bitterness towards the druids who are reluctantly hosting his people. He is exasperated, furious, but also eager to meet anyone who could help. He'll show a flash of anger and frustration at the start if the player struck him, but is pragmatic enough to calm himself once he realises you could be more help to him than harm.

Zevlor: Ngh. Mragreshem. || [context] InternalNodeContext: Remember he could have been KO by Aradin. The flag PostConfrontationDone will make him move after the dialogNodeContext: mrag-RESH-em. Means 'shithead' in infernal. Zevlor has just woken up after being punched in the face by Aradin. He's groggy and pissed off.
Zevlor: A cheap shot - to be expected from a drow. But you helped us, so instead of killing you, I'll just ask: || [context] NodeContext: Sneering, barely keeping his temper in check
Zevlor: Who in the Nine Hells do you think you are? || [context] NodeContext: absolutely seething
Player: Are you all right?
Zevlor: I'll survive a sore jaw. What I won't tolerate is a stranger waltzing in here and interfering in our business.
Zevlor: Lucky for you, you seem to have spooked that adventurer trash into leaving.
Zevlor: Whatever your business, I'd see to it quickly - the druids are forcing everyone out. || [context] NodeContext: Cautionary - his people are also being forced out
Zevlor: This attack will only strengthen their resolve. || [context] NodeContext: Grim, foreboding - and tired
Player: I won't be staying long - I just need to find a healer.
Zevlor: They've started a ritual to cut the grove off from the world outside.
Zevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters. || [context] NodeContext: Weary, doesn't know what to do
Player: This ritual - is there no way to convince the druids to stop it?
Zevlor: I've tried. Kagha - their new First Druid - won't even see me. || [context] NodeContext: Out of ideas
Zevlor: You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place. || [context] NodeContext: Slowly and thoughtfully - considering you, idea just occurring to him
Zevlor: Perhaps you could persuade her. For more time to prepare, if nothing else.
Player: I'll see what I can do. || [approval] ['Astarion -1', "Lae'zel -1", 'Gale 1', 'Wyll 5', 'Karlach 3']

Olodan: Tsk. That damned nose of yours has gone poking in our business.
Kagha: Mistress Olodan, I can explain...

Session Sequence: RaidAdventurerAtCorpses -> RaidAdventurer -> VB_AtCorpses -> LeaderAtCorpses -> AD_DrunkenTalk
----- Session: RaidAdventurerAtCorpses -----
Synopsis: The adventurer is standing next to the corpses of her comrades she left behind while running for the goblins.

Remira: I told them to run, the idiots.
Remira: You better turn north here, or you'll end up like them.

----- Session: RaidAdventurer -----
Synopsis: Age: mid-30-40s.
Female
Bio: Rough and working-class. A veteran of many expeditions, Remira is nonetheless shaken after a raid gone horribly wrong and trying to hide it behind bravado. She feels guilty for leaving a new recruit to die, but tries to wave it away and gets defensive if confronted over it. She’s sarcastic and casually racist.

Remira: Ah, the fighting foulblood. Glad to know one of you has a spine. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: She cleans her wound, a cut on her arm with a [cleaning cloth]
Player: I already regret saving your life.
Remira: Ah - bruised your feelings, did I? Excuse me if I don't weep - got problems of my own. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Finishes cleaning wound and puts the [cleaning cloth] away.
Remira: My arm's near hanging off after wise Zevlor left us to die at the gate.
Remira: And then he has the bloody gall to try and blame it all on us.
Player: He let you in, didn't he? It could have been worse.
Remira: Oh, very gracious of you. || [context] NodeContext: You're trying to be gracious and she's not having any of it.
Remira: We expected a soft job. Something to test the new lad, maybe, but not a bloody goblin nest. || [context] NodeContext: She's justifying her actions - they'd taken on a job that seemed simple but quickly got out of hand. People died and she's doggedly maintaining that she's the victim. More explanatory than whiny, though.
Remira: Most would've turned tail at the sight. But not Liam, no - he charged them, the stupid bastard. || [context] NodeContext: She's genuinely hurt at the loss of this recruit but projecting a knowing persona to hide it, as if his bravery is somehow a rookie mistake. Note of incredulity rather than laughing at him, as if he did something very stupid.
Player: So you just left your friend to the goblins?
Remira: These weren't no normal goblins. And Liam weren't no friend, all right? || [context] NodeContext: Immediately defensive - you're questioning her courage and suggesting she has feelings, two cardinal sins
Remira: Just another raw recruit thought he was in some storybook. || [context] NodeContext: Dismissive, disgusted - it's his own fault he's dead. Or that's what she's trying to tell herself.

----- Session: VB_AtCorpses -----

----- Session: AD_DrunkenTalk -----
Synopsis: Aradin mutters to himself while drinking after returning to the Druid Grove.

Aradin: 'Easy money.' Yeah right.

Narrator: *You are forgiven - this time.*

----- Session: Thieflings_HideoutTrespassCaught_Crime -----
Synopsis: Non-critpath. Occurs when a guard confronts players who have offended Mol, teenage crime boss in the Druid Grove. The player can try talk their way out of trouble, attempt a bribe, fight or surrender.

Narrator: *It seems Mol was as good as her word. She's reported that you've been threatening children.*
Player: Children? I haven't spoken to any children.

--- Scenario Details ---
======== Scenario: hag_hag ========
Session Sequence: PAD_TadpoleDivine
----- Session: PAD_TadpoleDivine -----
Synopsis: This VB plays after attempting to get Ethel to remove the tadpole. She confesses that there's something special about it and she can't remove it.Will play on the player who leaves the dialog that reveals this fact, but characters can be fairly opinionated here since they are reacting to knowledge.Up to two characters.

Player: The tadpole was tampered with? That complicates things...
Player: Tampered or not, we need to get these things out of our heads. Let's find another way.

======== Scenario: hag_forestillusion ========
Session Sequence: Illusioncheck_Prep
----- Session: Illusioncheck_Prep -----
Synopsis:

======== Scenario: hag_gurhunter ========
Session Sequence: PAD_BetrayedAstarion
----- Session: PAD_BetrayedAstarion -----
Synopsis: PAD that plays if you decide to tell the Gur Hunter in the Swamp where to find Astarion (HAG_GurHunter.lsj).  You tell the Hunter where your camp is, the Hunter says he'll take Astarion during the night the next time you go to sleep, then the dialog ends and this PAD plays.Your companion reacts to your decision to hand Astarion over (speaker 2) and then you clarify/justify your decision (speaker 1)

Player: You gave him up? I wasn't sure you would.
Player: He's too dangerous to have around. We'd always be sleeping with one eye open.

======== Scenario: hag_hagambush ========
Session Sequence: PAD_SidedHag
----- Session: PAD_SidedHag -----
Synopsis: This VB plays after saving Ethel from the two brothers of the sister she's holding captive. Ether disappeared in a magic puff, and she was acting suspicious. The players are reacting to her exit and discussing that there may be more to Ethel than meets the eye.Speaker 1 may have been the character who was in dialog for the scene with Ethel. Speaker 2 is another party member. However, since there may be combat, this setup isn't guaranteed and it's best to write this assuming everyone had a hand in the actions that led to this VB playing.

Player: Bloody way to end an argument. I hope we chose the right side.
Player: No point in debating what's already done. Let's go on ahead.

======== Scenario: hag_bhvr ========
Session Sequence: WRLD_GettingBloodFromTrough
----- Session: WRLD_GettingBloodFromTrough -----
Synopsis: Timeline scene trigger for redcap getting blood from a trough

======== Scenario: hag_well ========
Session Sequence: 
======== Scenario: hag_gurhunter ========
Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Male, middle-age or older.Gandrel is a monster hunter we encounter outside the Hag's lair. He's pleasant, cheerful, and a little eccentric - but shows his experience and expertise when warning us about the hag. He's affable and unassuming, but shows moments of steel when discussing his quarry (Astarion). A younger General Iroh from Avatar is a good reference - someone who makes you feel good about yourself just by conversing with you.

Gandrel: Ah, a fellow wanderer. Forgive the aroma. || [context] NodeContext: Friendly - noticing a stranger, wryly apologising for the slight stench
Narrator: *You catch a waft of something foul - metallic and sickly-sweet.*
Gandrel: Powdered iron-vine. Most monsters will think twice before making a meal of me. || [context] NodeContext: Explaining the smell in the air - he's taken a foul substance designed to ward off monsters
Gandrel: An old hunter's trick - if you can't mask your scent, spoil it. || [context] NodeContext: Friendly, unassuming, as if what he's saying is perfectly conventional
Player: Who are you?
Gandrel: Today? The same as you - a humble supplicant, come to bargain with the lady of this house.
Gandrel: A sharp wit will serve you better, if you're to bargain with the lady of this house.
Gandrel: That is why you come to her lair, I take it? To bargain? || [context] NodeContext: Gently prodding for our story
Player: It's a teahouse - hardly a lair.
Gandrel: A charming sight, to be sure. But the prettiest web still has a spider sitting at its centre. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Shot of sign for tea-house here if possible.
Gandrel: Her kind have hidden among us since the first darkness - and their knowledge is matched only by their spite. || [context] NodeContext: Growing slightly grave - telling us of a great evil thing that is not to be underestimated
Gandrel: Know how to ask, and they'll share that knowledge. If you're fool enough to pay their price. || [context] NodeContext: Telling us the risk might be worth the reward - but is is a great risk
Player: What price is that?
Gandrel: Whatever's easiest to lose and hardest to do without.
Gandrel: But the thing I hunt has gone to ground. If she can tell me how to draw him out, I'll pay whatever she asks.
Gandrel: But she thrives on suffering. Once she hears what awaits my quarry when I catch him, she will help. || [context] NodeContext: Growing grave
Player: Who is it you're hunting?
Gandrel: Truth is like a blade, my friend. We can arm ourselves with it. || [context] NodeContext: Grave - we're asking a question he believes we don't really want the answer to
Gandrel: Or just as easily find it pressed against our throat. I would not put you in danger. || [context] NodeContext: Grave - we're asking a question he believes we don't really want the answer to. The warning is for our own good, not a threat
Player: Never mind. I already regret asking.
Gandrel: Questions should never bring you regret, my friend. Answers are another matter. || [context] NodeContext: Softening the blow of his refusal to answer our questions

--- Scenario Details ---
======== Scenario: for_schoologre2 ========
Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Ogre in the middle of a meal. Dumb as a box of rocks. Mistakes you momentarily for a chicken.

Fank: Chicken?
Fank: No. You not chicken.

======== Scenario: for_goblinambush ========
Session Sequence: CheckpointGuards -> PAD_SpottedAmbush ->  -> PatrollingGoblin
----- Session: CheckpointGuards -----
Synopsis: This goblin is guarding the entrance to a town his squad have occupied. The residents are long-dead, the town abandoned, and so he's taken it upon himself to rechristen the village as 'Bogrot'.

Goblin Warrior: 'Allo and welcome to Bogrot! Now, kindly - giz all your stuff. || [context] NodeContext: A goblin's closest approximation of courtesty, faintly mocking. He's loudly welcoming you to the town he has dubbed 'Bogrot'
Narrator: *A strange symbol glows, marked on their flesh, and something within you stirs in response.*

----- Session: PAD_SpottedAmbush -----
Synopsis: This PAD plays if players pass a successful Perception check when entering an abandoned village. Goblins are sneaking around in the village, setting up an ambush.

Player: Something's waiting up ahead.

----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: This dialogue triggers when players enter a village being guarded by goblins.

Synopsis: In SwA, the owlbear speaks like a human. Her voice is deep and threatening - the voice of a seasoned fighter, at home in a fight and used to winning. However, she knows she's injured and at a disadvantage, but refuses to betray that to the player. Doing so might encourage the player to attack, putting her cub in danger.The player stumbles upon the nest of an owlbear; a large, predatory hybrid creature. They find themselves in a stand-off against the beast - if they get too close or act aggressively, it attacks. If they keep cool and back off when the opportunity presents itself, the owlbear will let them leave. The player may also notice that the owlbear is wounded - a broken spear protrudes from one eye socket. They may notice that the owlbear has a cub - this is the main reason for her aggression and territoriality.Additional note 1: the player may stumble upon this scenario by themselves, or they may have been pointed in the right direction after meeting some cultists who had a close encounter with the owlbear. If we won these cultists over, they may be available to fight the owlbear at our side.Additional note 2: If the owlbear mother is killed but her cub survives, we can decide the juvenile's fate. If we spare it, we may later find it being used for sport by the goblins in their camp.

Narrator: *You feel the quake of its heavy footsteps before you see it: an owlbear, its beaked face looming out of the darkness.*
Owlbear: What's this? Something weak, something tender... || [context] NodeContext: Sizing up the player.
Owlbear: Won't even have to chew you before I feed you to my son, softmeat.
Player: That eye - or lack of it - must have you in a lot of pain. I should know.
Owlbear: Scars don't make us kindred, softmeat. And they don't make you welcome in my nest.
Owlbear: You'll be missing more than your eye before I'm done.
Owlbear: The meat tastes better when it's afraid.
Player: Attack. || [approval] ["Lae'zel 1", 'Shadowheart -1', 'Karlach -1']

----- Session: VB_CubResolution_1P -----
Synopsis: The players comment briefly on their decision to let an orphaned owlbear cub live or not.

Player: Nature can provide for the cub. Perhaps it'll live. || [context] NodeContext: Reasoning decision to let an orphaned owlbear cub fend for itself.

----- Session: PAD_HealedOwlbear -----
Synopsis: A short VB after player heals the Owlbear in gameplay. Owlbear is still dangerous, though. This can happen either before or after the player has interacted with Owlbear. It's meant to give feedback on the fact that the owlbear is now healed, but not to encourage the player to provoke her.

Player: Healed - but she doesn't look much happier. || [context] NodeContext: Karlach: 'I healed you, owlbear--> you still look like you're gonna rip my face off.'

----- Session: VB_EggPickedUp -----
Synopsis: The player discovers an intact owlbear egg (think something the size of an ostrich egg) and makes an impressed remark. If there's an adult owlbear nearby, the player will remark that interferring with the egg will put them in danger.

Player: She'll tear me in two for touching her egg. || [context] NodeContext: Urgent. The player's taken an owlbear's unhatched egg while in combat with the owlbear mother (think a grizzly bear with a beak).

----- Session: VB_LastCub -----
Synopsis: After killing an adult owlbear, combat ends as the player notes that the surviving owlbear cub doesn't pose much of a threat to them.

Player: A lone cub isn't much of a threat...
Player: Not without its mother by its side. What now?

======== Scenario: for_monitor ========
Session Sequence: Dinner
----- Session: Dinner -----
Synopsis: The monitor has teleported you to a mysterious room and offered you dinner - and a deal.

Raphael: There. Middle-of-somewhere.
Karlach: I don't like this at all. || [context] NodeContext: This place is in the Hells, though Karlach doesn't realize that yet. She's put off but trying to stay cool.
Player: Nice decor.
Raphael: The House of Hope. Where the tired come to rest, and the famished come to feed - lavishly. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: He spreads his arms as he dramatically introduces this place.NodeContext: He spreads his arms as he dramatically introduces this place.
Raphael: Go on. Partake. Enjoy your supper. After all...
Raphael: ...it might just be your last.
Player: Ignore him and fill your plate.
Raphael: Not easily rattled, I see. Good. Makes the next part that much more straightforward.
Raphael: What's better than a devil you don't know?
Raphael: A devil you do.
Karlach: Fuck. A cambion. || [context] NodeContext: Surprise, even fear in her voice. This is early in the game so she's still fresh from the hells. Referring to Raphael's first revelation of who he is.

Session Sequence: 003_Dead
----- Session: 003_Dead -----
Synopsis: True Soul Edowin has been killed by an owlbear. This is his corpse speaking. He is concerned about his siblings and still devoted to the Absolute.

Narrator: *The corpse regards you lifelessly.*
Player: What were you doing here?
Edowin: Looking... for Her weapon... the Absolute...

Corsair Greymon: Gekh? Is that you?
Corsair Greymon: Hold on. You're not Gekh.
Player: I saw a body left by the myconids - your 'Gekh' must be dead.
: False
Corsair Greymon: What a load of rothé shite. No way a mushroom killed Gekh.
Corsair Greymon: Get them, fellas!

Session Sequence:  -> Saved
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: The gnome leader's main dialogue. He thanks you for saving them, and tells you what brought his people to the Underdark to begin with - an expedition led by their charismatic leader Wulbren, to find a forgotten gnomish explosive of awesome power - runepowder.

Lunkbug: Beldron - I was so worried! Did Nere hurt you? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Addressed to Beldron
Beldron: No, no - I'm all right. Did the sergeant hurt you? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Addressed to Lunkbug
Lunkbug: Who cares? We're together now, thank Ironhand! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Addressed to Beldron. The two gnomes embrace, and then pull apart.
Beldron: We ought to thank someone a little closer by, I think. || [context] NodeContext: Tired, wry - referencing the player when his husband thanks the gods
Beldron: Gaerdal Ironhand you may not be, but you damn well fight like him. || [context] NodeContext: Impressed with you - someone thanked the war-god Ironhand and he's implying you're the next best thing
Beldron: I'm grateful, don't mistake me, but... why help us? You're one of them, aren't you? || [context] NodeContext: Guarded, sizing the player up - he thinks we're one of the cultists
Player: The cult thinks it owns me. I beg to differ.
Beldron: That didn't much look like begging. But no complaints from me. || [context] NodeContext: Referencing the player's recent slaughter of his captors
Beldron: You did just lift a mountain from our heads, so... good enough for me, I reckon. || [context] NodeContext: Nodding, accepting - not going to look a gift horse in the mouth
Beldron: Here - the Ironhand Gnomes honour their debts. With Wulbren gone, that falls to me. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Standard 'handing reward' animation.NodeContext: Drawing himself up to perform a necessary obligation - doesn't see himself as leadership material but accepts the responsibility
Barcus Wroot: Make it quick! We need to find Wulbren - now.
Player: Surely you can do me a little more honour than that.
Beldron: I wish I could. But most of our funds rested with our leader, Wulbren. He'll be in Moonrise Towers by now.
Beldron: We were just slave-hands to the cult, but not Wulbren. He... knows things. Things they want to know too. || [context] NodeContext: Hesitant to say exactly what Wulbren knows
Barcus Wroot: What has he gotten himself mixed up in now...
Player: Before you ask, no - I'm not going to stage a rescue.
Beldron: Aye. Nor us, I'm afraid. || [context] NodeContext: shrugging, a little defeated. This line trails off into another 'Much as I want to march after Wulbren myself... we can't.'
Beldron: We have our own freedom to look to, I'm afraid. We'll take our chance when it arises, then back to the city. || [context] NodeContext: His people are still enslaved - he needs to be pragmatic.
Beldron: Wulbren knew the risks when he came in search of runepowder. We all did.

----- Session: Saved -----
Synopsis: Dialog for gnome foreman on the other side of the ebon lake after they were saved by player. Mentions the other gnomes being kept at moonrise towers.

Beldron: Thanks again for offing that drow. Only made it here 'cause of you. But I can't stop thinking about the rest of us...
Beldron: ... stuck in Moonrise with a bunch of sadists. Poor bastards.

----- Session: AD_NoAnswerFromGod -----
Synopsis: The player has clicked an altar from which a godly presence spoke previously.

Narrator: *There is no answer from the presence.*

----- Session: SpeakWithBOOOAL -----
Synopsis: The player encounters a group of kuo-toa, humanoid fish beings capable of creating gods just by imagining them. They're overzealous and easily duped, and are currently worshipping a murderous redcap they've mistaken for a god of murder. He's capitalising on the situation and very much enjoying the incredible power with which he's been invested. In this dialogue, we can deal with him as this great inscrutable power, or see through the situation and expose / do a deal with him. In all cases he's brash, offensive and generally gross.The all cap lines are BOOOAL in his fully powerful form.When we suddenly rever to lower caps, it's when we've forced him into his 'common' form.BOOOAL = Boo-AHHL (almost guttural)Kuo-Toa = Koo-oh-TO-ah

Pooldripp the Zealous: Our blood to fill your oceans, oh blessed BOOOAL! Our bones to build your temple in the deep! || [context] NodeContext: Fanatic devotion, speaking to the air/altar
Narrator: *A wave of pure devotion washes over you - and with every surge, you feel a presence grow in response.*
BOOOAL: WORDS, PRIEST. PROMISES. YOUR GOD WANTS PROOF. WANTS BLOOD. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: BOOOAL is in his god form. He should be invisible with some VFXNodeContext: DISMISSIVE, IMPATIENT

Pooldripp the Zealous: YOU! Our Lord of Murder demands sacrifice! You will be an offering for the great god BOOOAL! || [context] NodeContext: Fanatic, excited
Player: Bhaal is the true Lord of Murder. Perhaps I should offer you instead.
Pooldripp the Zealous: Bhaal...? No... we are... we are faithful to Lord BOOOAL... || [context] NodeContext: Confused, taken aback
Narrator: *You sense a flicker of doubt - brief, but enough. For an instant, the godly presence falters.*
BOOOAL: NO! NO! Stop that! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: BOOOAL is in the process of reverting back to his common form. He is invisible for "NO! NO" and becomes visible for "Stop that!"NodeContext: Furious, panicked - his con is being exposed and he's losing power even as he speaks
Player: He's a fabrication. Whatever you created him for, you don't need him.
: True
BOOOAL: ARGH! NO! SHUT IT! Shut your rotten mouth! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: BOOOAL is in the process of reverting back into his common form. He is invisible for the capitalised parts of this now, but then becomes visible for "Shut your rotten mouth"NodeContext: The lack of faith is literally draining power from him - sulky and furious all in one as he returns to his common form
Narrator: *You feel the presence waver - one moment a god of awesome power, the next... a common redcap.*
BOOOAL: Ah. Bollocks. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: BOOOAL is in his common form. He is no longer invisible, and he appears as a redacapNodeContext: Realising the game is up
BOOOAL: Don't do anything hasty, now. The fishfolk got plenty of power - we can share.<br> || [context] CinematicNodeContext: BOOOAL is in his common form. He is no longer invisible, and appears as a common redcapNodeContext: Still annoyed with us but willing to make a deal. Only SLIGHTLY wheedling - redcaps aren't known for negotiating
Pooldripp the Zealous: ... blessed Boooal... what...? || [context] NodeContext: Hesitant
BOOOAL: Shut it, you!  I'm talking to... my Chosen! Chosen got power - you want power, don't ya? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: BOOOAL is in his common form. He is no longer invisible, and just appears as an ordinary redcapNodeContext: Shouting his high priest down - he wants to seal the deal with us before his idiot followers fully catch on

Session Sequence: PAD_KnowStashIsHidden
----- Session: PAD_KnowStashIsHidden -----
Synopsis: Note: this PAD follows directly from either RecogniseStashLocation or FoundRune. See Kevin V. with any questions, I know it is a bit weird.--------When the player recognises that the Harper rune in Ketheric City is marking a hidden stash, they make an Investigation check. On success, they realise that the Harpers would be smart enough not to leave their stash in plain sight - the goal of this hint is to deter the player from interacting with the mimics in the area and to instead look around for a hidden stash somewhere

Player: Must be in one of these chests.

----- Session: DwarvenAlchemist -----
Synopsis: Derryth is a dwarven alchemist visiting the underdark from Baldur's Gate. She runs a shop in the city with Baelen, her business partner. They've come to the underdark in search of a very valuable mushroom - noblestalk. When the player arrived, she was tending to an injured gnome.
Derryth is a bit gruff - she's a healer, but her bedside manner leaves a lot to be desired. She's also a very shrewd businessperson. She's in the underdark to get rich first and foremost.
She treats her business partner (Baelen) like he's an idiot, and pretends not to care about him, but in reality he is the most important person to her in the world.

Derryth Bonecloak: Just leave me, I said. You've done enough damage already.
Derryth Bonecloak: You don't know what you've done. Leave me be. || [context] NodeContext: Player cured Baelen. She's facing a terrible future.
Player: I know exactly what I've done. Very entertaining. || [approval] ['Wyll -1', 'Karlach -1']
Derryth Bonecloak: You're a beast - you and Baelen  would make fine bedfellows.
Derryth Bonecloak: Get out of my face. Find some else's suffering to lap up.

----- Session: AD_CheckpointGuard_002_Combat -----
Synopsis: One-shot combat AD to play when the myconid is taking their turn.

Restless Myconid: ((*the disease still festers. I will cut it out*))

----- Session: CheckpointGuard_001 -----
Synopsis: Individual myconid responds with one-liner after you have gained access to the myconid circle. Hallucinogenic delivery.

Narrator: *The creature's song rumbles within you, neither warm nor welcoming.*

----- Session: VB_GlutDead_1P -----
Synopsis: Players refuse to kill Sovereign Spawn on Sovereign Glut's behalf. Glut has attacked the players and is now dead. The party comments afterwards.

Player: The usurper is dead. So much for 'Circle Glut'.

----- Session: CheckpointGuard_000 -----
Synopsis: You come upon the myconid guards. They warn the sovereign of your presence telepathically, and it begins to speak to you. This should be creepy, hallucinatory.

Narrator: *You are swallowed by a chorus of turbulent music. Through one creature sing many voices: the harmony of an entire collective.*
Restless Myconid: ((*Sovereign. they have come. they are here*))
Narrator: *The choir fades. A single melody rises above the others, brassy and commanding.*
: ((*I am Sovereign*))
Narrator: *You see a vision: your lifeless body, wrapped in fungal tendrils. The sovereign is threatening you.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Player closes eyes as if seeing the vision in their head.
: ((*state your purpose*))
Player: I am a traveller seeking adventure. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Player closes eyes.
: True
Narrator: *Fungal roots weave through your mind, seeking your true intent.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Player closes eyes as if to see the vision. || [approval] ['Gale 1', 'Shadowheart 1', 'Wyll 1', 'Karlach 1']
Narrator: *Then the sovereign drones a new melody, cautious but welcoming.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Overhead view, as sovereign is not in sight range.
: ((*descend to me. let us speak in flesh*)) || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Overhead view, as sovereign is not in sight range. (Custom cameras required)
Narrator: *The persistent music coaxes you forward. The sovereign expects you.*

----- Session: DeepRothe -----
Synopsis: A Deep Rothe that belongs to Derryth and Baelen Bonecloak. A beast of burden with a simple Speak with Animals dialogue. There's some reactivity depending on whether Baelen has returned to the bonecloak camp or not, and if Baelen recovered his senses by eating the noblestalk mushroom. The animal's observations reinforce that Baelen has been more amiable and gentle since his mind began to slip, and his recovery is not seen as a good thing by all.

Deep Rothé: Master sounds different, like old self. Angry self. Don't like. || [context] NodeContext: SWA line. Reproachful. A simple beast of burden senses his master has returned to a crueler demeanour.

He talks about his research and, if the tadpole is mentioned, brings his mind flayer friend Omeluum to talk to the player. The player can either agree to the mind flayer's help or attack.

Blurg: I must complete this study. Entertain yourself elsewhere.

----- Session: SocietyOfBrilliance_MindFlayer -----
Synopsis: Omeluum is a friendly, neutral mind flayer and member of the Society of Brilliance, dedicated to improving life in the Underdark. If attacked, it will teleport away rather than engaging in combat.

Omeluum: I greet you, friend of the dark.
Omeluum: I greet you, sun child.
Player: How do you survive? Don't you need... brains?
Omeluum: In the beginning, I had an arrangement with a lich. Excellent company, despite what one would expect.
Omeluum: I required brains, he required souls. A perfect symbiosis.
Omeluum: But our ambitions eventually splintered. I wished to better the world, and he preferred its rot.
Omeluum: So I left his company, and thus I now feed from those who... act against the Society's goals.
Player: Best way to deal with that sort of hunger, I suppose.
Omeluum: Perhaps the peoples of the Underdark will be less inclined to violence if they comprehend the cost, yes?
Omeluum: I greet you, sun child.
Player: I'd like to learn more about the tadpole.<br> || [approval] ['Karlach 1']
Narrator: *An almost childlike joy enters Omeluum's ichor-laced eyes.*
Omeluum: Open your mind to me, friend. Let us see what lurks within.
Player: Never mind. I'm done with mind flayers touching me.
Omeluum: I see. I will remain here if you decide otherwise.

Narrator: *The monstrosity stares blankly forward.*

----- Session: DirectToSovereign -----
Synopsis: If you speak to a myconid after the guards speak to you but you have not yet spoken to the sovereign, his voice will speak through them.

Narrator: *Fungus and mould glaze the grotesque creature's face and body.*
Narrator: *A voice drifts into your mind as you gaze upon the misshapen servant.*
: ((*leave this one. come to me. we must speak*))

----- Session: BroodingSovereign -----
Synopsis: A sovereign myconid we call the brooding sovereign has been displaced to this myconid circle, after the duergar attackes his home. He would like to join you as you cleanse the area of duergar as a means of getting revenge - supposedly.

 The top block: The borroding myconid is with the other myconids. You can recruit it.

The middle block: You have killed the lone duergar. the myconid now wants you to kill all the duergars.

 Next block: you have killed all the duergars; now it wants you to kill the sovereign
. 
Final block: you have killed the sovereign and it rewards you. 

This myconid does not speak with the same hive mind voice of the others. He should sound creepy, like FART in Rick and Morty, with a SLIGHT undercurrent of menace.

 As the quest moves on, he gets more and more creepy and angry,

Sovereign Glut: ((*the tumour is excised. the duergar are dead*))
Sovereign Glut: ((*here, I break ground. from the dark will a mighty Circle rise. my song will fill the Grotto!*))
Sovereign Glut: ((*death-doer - the Grotto may sustain but one Sovereign. in the Age of Glut...*))
Sovereign Glut: ((*...there may be no Spaw. eliminate the other Sovereign*))
Player: Why not. Spaw's time is done. || [approval] ['Astarion 1', 'Wyll -1']
Sovereign Glut: ((*come, then. bring me to Spaw and I will sing its doom*))
Sovereign Glut: ((*the Age of Glut begins*))

----- Session: Automaton -----
Synopsis: This is an old robot guarding the top of a deserting tower. His master programmed him to speak in verse. He talks mostly in iambic pentameter (though sometimes in iambic hexameter) - think shakespearian verse.Translator node: this dialogue is linked to other poems in the game, and uses the same words. For more information, please read the 'Riddles and word puzzles of note' doc!

Bernard: Command as you see fit, my lord, my liege. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The robot bows.

Player: What is this place?
Bernard: An unbeknownst command that I cannot fulfil.

When players first encounter Benryn, he is trapped beneath a heavy beam in a burning building. If the player helps him escape, Benryn joins the party until they exit the building safely. Once outside, Benryn is in shock at the carnage around him - bodies of goblins and humans litter the inn's courtyard. He snaps out of his shock when he thinks of his wife, who was outside when the raiding party arrived. He pleads for the player to help him find her - when players do, she is already dead.

----- Session: CINE_RiderAndDragonLeave -----
Synopsis: Cinematic: Kith'rak Voss flies away on his dragon.The player interrupted the Gith Chokepoint situation. The most likely interruption is triggering a combat (player attacks any npc there including Voss or the dragon, or drags another hostile npc near them)This interruption happens in gameplay, so normally the Rider (Kith'rak Voss) and the Dragon would also leave in gameplay, but animations don't have the tech support to make the Rider ride the dragon like this, so we play this cutscene instead

[desc] CinematicNodeContext: ~The dragon spreads its wings and soars away.
NOTE: this could be used in a number of circumstances in which Voss flies away. Voss is an arrogant senior gith officer, focused on his mission, so he can always depart while being unfazed by preceeding events. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: ~The dragon spreads its wings and soars away.

----- Session: Flind -----
Synopsis: The flind is the leader of a pack of gnolls. Normally, these monsters hunger for flesh and eat anything, but the flind has been infected with a mind flayer's tadpole (like the players) and this has created an internal 'Voice' that guides it toward certain meat, forbidding others. The forbidden meats are those that work for the mind flayers - including the players - leading to a telepathic 'dialogue' when the flind restrains itself from attacking and calls off its pack.

We can attempt to overpower the Flind psionically, allowing us to control it temporarily in order to destroy the pack of gnolls. If we choose to fight the Flind, we should be prepared for a difficult encounter. It is strong, though far from the most powerful of its kind thanks to the war raging in its brain.

Synopsis: Thematically, this VB is a conversation about the goblin camp and how difficult it might be to find the druid there. Player will be aware that he's being held captive somewhere in the camp and can see the goblins's strength.This occurs over walking into a trigger, so lines between speaker 1 and speaker 2 can be fairly opinionated.

Player: The druid Halsin is in here somewhere.
Player: Let's hope we find him in one piece.

Player: They're seeking a weapon. I wonder if they mean that odd artefact...
Player: If that's the case, we've got more problems than just the worms in our heads.

======== Scenario: gob_goblinpriest ========

----- Session: MaskedVictim1 -----
Synopsis: A victim of the hag, forced to wear a mask that takes away her free will so that she fights for and serves the hag. If the hag is killed, this character regains her senses and resolve. She's deeply shaken by her experience, but courageous, telling the player that she'll inform the people of Baldur's Gate of our heroism, and vowing to hunt down the hag's accomplices in the city.

Mask of Regret: We need to leave. You're not supposed to be here - she'll be furious. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: panicked, confused, as if coming out of a stuporNodeContext: confused, afraid
Player: You served her - give me one good reason to let you live.
Mask of Regret: It was the mask. It dug its roots into me... took away my will. I tried to fight it. || [context] NodeContext: explaining something she barely understands
Player: Attack. || [approval] ['Astarion 1', 'Shadowheart 1', 'Wyll -1', 'Karlach -1']

----- Session: Victim_001 -----
Synopsis: The dwarf was turned to stone by the hag to stop the spread of an deadly disease - Laduguer's Bite. Little does he know that the hag was the one who cause the disease in the first place.

Efrin: Ungh... what... argh... what in the bloody hells is going on? || [context] NodeContext: You were turned to stone and you're just coming out of it. Dazed, confused, touching your head.
Player: I removed the petrification spell.
Efrin: You did what? But - but you can't! || [context] NodeContext: Player has removed a spell that prevented you from dying. Panic and rage as you try to explain.
Player: You should be grateful. I expect payment.
Efrin: Grateful? I've got Laduguer's Bite! I'm dying! Why else do you think I was petrified? || [context] NodeContext: You have an incurable disease and the player has basically condemned you to death. You start to freak out as you realise the implications.

----- Session: TalkingDoor -----
Synopsis: The door guarding the entrance to the hag's lair. It's actually transparent and the player can walk through it. It's a cut scene as the door tries to project images onto the player and communicate to them. Pleading with them to leave. The door was a thief that was taken by Ethel and torn to shreds, with the remainder of his body transformed into a door.Much of this is a 'cut scene' as the door projects visions into the player's mind instead of communicating.

Narrator: *You feel crushing waves of fear as a presence within the door recoils. It can't let people through. Not again!* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Just a shot of the player and the door - no visions yet. Player pressing a hand to their head as waves of fear hit them.

Mayrina: Get me out of this hellhole! || [context] NodeContext: The hag has sent out illusions that look like you. You're horrified and crying out to the player, running towards them for safety. It's in the middle of a fight and you're scared but still being your usual bratty and petulant self.

Player: Why did you go to the hag?
