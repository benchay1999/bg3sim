Player: That's a complicated story. I doubt you'd understand.
Bosk: I didn't mean to pry.

----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Volo is a canonical character in DnD. He's known for being the realm's go-to guy for compiling information. In this take, he fulfils that role but puts a twist on what he sees. He's keenly curious for facts but likes to embellish them. A bit like Gilderoy Lockheart. He IS talented, but his reputation has gotten away from him, too. In this dialogue, Volo will offer to put his knowledge at your service if you confide you've been infected with a mindflayer. He'll perform an icepick lobotomy that'll leave you without an eye or much in the way of apology from Volo. He should be clever, a little arrogant, very English, and very fun, without being a cartoon character.

Volo: Ah, my good friend! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: He's holding a book and a quill, scribbling notations when he notices you.NodeContext: He's holding a book and a quill, scribbling notations when he notices you. He's happy to see you, he has questions for you!

Volo: You were at the gates just now, no? When the goblins came? You saw them up close? || [context] NodeContext: He's about to start quizzing you on what you saw. Eager.

Player: Fine - ask your questions.
Volo: Glory! Now, then: || [context] CinematicNodeContext: He's ready to write, quill to book.NodeContext: Player agreed to answer his questions. He's happy but also arrogant, like a rich old person saying 'you're an absolute DOLL' when you do a minor favor for them.
Volo: How would you describe that particular batch of goblins? Size? Nature? Distinguishing qualities? || [context] NodeContext: Quizzing the player, looking for info for his book. He's more professional here, curious.
: True
Narrator: *You search your mind, successfully recalling various details of goblin behaviour.*
Player: Common variety goblins, led by a lasher and flanked by booyahgs.
Volo: My! A scholar after my own heart. Spent much time among goblins?
Player: The time was spent among books. I'm a student of the page. || [approval] ['Gale 1']
Volo: Aha! I've always preferred experience to the second-hand accounts of lesser men. But to each their own!
Volo: Now I've a few more questions, if you don't mind.
Volo: And the... dragon they had marching in the rear. Was it of the brass or silver variety? || [context] NodeContext: Volo is bullshitting. There was no dragon and he knows it. But he's stating it to the player as though he believes it.
Player: Dragon...? There wasn't any dragon.
Volo: 'Witnesses... failed... to... notice the... obvious... dragon...' || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Scribbling in notebookNodeContext: Response to 'I told him there was no dragon.' Volo's sensationalizing again.
Volo: Last question, then you'll be quite free. Did the attackers rally to 'the Absolute' when they fell upon the gates? || [context] NodeContext: He's wrapping things up, in full journalism mode.
Player: Yes - they called out the name like a war cry.
Volo: They did, didn't they? Oh-ho, curious. Curious indeed. || [context] NodeContext: Answers that yes, the goblins used the word 'Absolute'. He's very interested in this; very intrigued. Your confirmation is exactly what he wanted to hear.
Volo: I've interrogated one - a captive in this very camp. She reports they've abandoned their god Maglubiyet in favour of someone called 'the Absolute'.
Volo: The scandal! || [context] NodeContext: Hissed like he's just conveyed a very juicy bit of gossip
Player: Goblin superstition - not worth the ink and parchment.

Player: Better a quick draught than ceremorphosis, nonetheless.
Player: Better to have on hand than not.

----- Session: Cyanide -----
Synopsis: Nettie leads the player into a lab and fetches a thorn. The player doesn't know, but the thorn is a deadly poison. Nettie knows it's the only choice she has - the player could transform into a monster and kill everyone in the camp. She sees this as a kindness - the transformation is terrible - so she has a very 'matter of fact nurse' tone about the whole thing before she scratches you, but will get stressed if you resist. Once she's scratched the player, her tone will be softer - kinder. She plans to sit with you while you pass and make it as easy as possible. The player will have to convince her they're not a threat if they're going to get the antidote. She'll be slow to convince, hesitant to allow any risk to the camp.

Synopsis: Nerela is wondering whether to sell a music box, the only memento she has of the husband and daughter who were killed by gnolls on the road here. It's a scam - her story is fabricated and the box is a dime a dozen. Player can comfort her or see through her story. Her overall demeanour is weary, fragile (unless you uncover her scam)

Player: |Cinematic: The woman cradled a carved wooden box, from which a soft melody chimed.| || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Lost in thought, holding the box as it's the most precious thing in the world.NodeContext: Sitting
Player: Close that box. The music is grating.
Nerela: Oh! Of course, how thoughtless. I beg your pardon - I'm not fan of it myself, truth be told. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Closing the music box mid-sentence, cutting music off.NodeContext: Caught by surprise, embarrassed. The last line is her awkward effort at getting you on-side by agreeing with you.
Nerela: Said as much to my husband when he made the bloody thing.
Nerela: But it kept our little monster quiet. Reason to love it if nothing else, trust me. || [context] NodeContext: A tired and exasperated parent, remembering.
Nerela: ... how much do you think it's worth? Old Ethel said she'd offer me gold for it. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: She closes the box and plays her fingers along the lid. Abruptly, she offers it up.NodeContext: Hesitant and suddenly serious, intent on  your response

Nerela: ... you're right. I'm sure you don't want to listen to my prattling. Sorry. || [context] NodeContext: Hurt but hiding it - she's just told you something heartbreaking and you've dismissed her trauma.

----- Session: RaidAdventurerAtCorpses -----
Synopsis: The adventurer is standing next to the corpses of her comrades she left behind while running for the goblins.

Remira: I told them to run, the idiots.
Remira: You better turn north here, or you'll end up like them.

----- Session: RaidAdventurer -----
Synopsis: Age: mid-30-40s.
Female
Bio: Rough and working-class. A veteran of many expeditions, Remira is nonetheless shaken after a raid gone horribly wrong and trying to hide it behind bravado. She feels guilty for leaving a new recruit to die, but tries to wave it away and gets defensive if confronted over it. She’s sarcastic and casually racist.

Remira: Ah, the fighting foulblood. Glad to know one of you has a spine. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: She cleans her wound, a cut on her arm with a [cleaning cloth]
Player: I already regret saving your life.
Remira: Ah - bruised your feelings, did I? Excuse me if I don't weep - got problems of my own. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Finishes cleaning wound and puts the [cleaning cloth] away.
Remira: My arm's near hanging off after wise Zevlor left us to die at the gate.
Remira: And then he has the bloody gall to try and blame it all on us.
Player: He let you in, didn't he? It could have been worse.
Remira: Oh, very gracious of you. || [context] NodeContext: You're trying to be gracious and she's not having any of it.
Remira: We expected a soft job. Something to test the new lad, maybe, but not a bloody goblin nest. || [context] NodeContext: She's justifying her actions - they'd taken on a job that seemed simple but quickly got out of hand. People died and she's doggedly maintaining that she's the victim. More explanatory than whiny, though.
Remira: Most would've turned tail at the sight. But not Liam, no - he charged them, the stupid bastard. || [context] NodeContext: She's genuinely hurt at the loss of this recruit but projecting a knowing persona to hide it, as if his bravery is somehow a rookie mistake. Note of incredulity rather than laughing at him, as if he did something very stupid.

The illusion can be shattered by an animal handling check. OR if the player preciously succeeded in a perception check in the area.

Narrator: *The sheep's voice warbles. You realise it's trying to say 'Baa'.*
Player: Drop your eyes and carefully reach out.
: False
Narrator: *Wheezing, the sheep backs away.*

The player may or may not recognise her as such, but either way her attitude is blunt, breezy and unscrupulous.

Roah Moonglow: Till this crowd converted and started sending their captives to Moonrise Towers, at least. || [context] NodeContext: Correcting herself. Tone is rueful - some of her best trading partners have fallen to organised religion.
Roah Moonglow: No complaints, mind - I just sold enough smokepowder to cover the loss ten times over. || [context] NodeContext: Perking up - she still managed to make a profit. Always a bright side.
Player: What do the goblins want smokepowder for?
Roah Moonglow: Ask the drow they're all bowing to. That glint in her eye is bad news for someone. || [context] NodeContext: Shrug - it's not her problem, but she pities whoever the drow is planning to deal with.
Roah Moonglow: Not my concern, so long as I'm paid. Speaking of - something to trade, or what? || [context] NodeContext: Shrugging, getting back to the matter at hand. She's used to minding her own business - and everything is just business to her.
Roah Moonglow: Now - much obliged for the chat, but I'm here to trade. || [context] NodeContext: Insincere about the chat - she's just Impatient to get back to the matter at hand.
Player: Let me see your wares.

======== Scenario: for_village ========
Session Sequence: 
======== Scenario: for_owlbear ========
Session Sequence:  -> VB_CubResolution_1P -> AD_HatchedEgg -> VB_EnterCave
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: In SwA, the owlbear speaks like a human. Her voice is deep and threatening - the voice of a seasoned fighter, at home in a fight and used to winning. However, she knows she's injured and at a disadvantage, but refuses to betray that to the player. Doing so might encourage the player to attack, putting her cub in danger.The player stumbles upon the nest of an owlbear; a large, predatory hybrid creature. They find themselves in a stand-off against the beast - if they get too close or act aggressively, it attacks. If they keep cool and back off when the opportunity presents itself, the owlbear will let them leave. The player may also notice that the owlbear is wounded - a broken spear protrudes from one eye socket. They may notice that the owlbear has a cub - this is the main reason for her aggression and territoriality.Additional note 1: the player may stumble upon this scenario by themselves, or they may have been pointed in the right direction after meeting some cultists who had a close encounter with the owlbear. If we won these cultists over, they may be available to fight the owlbear at our side.Additional note 2: If the owlbear mother is killed but her cub survives, we can decide the juvenile's fate. If we spare it, we may later find it being used for sport by the goblins in their camp.

Narrator: *You feel the quake of its heavy footsteps before you see it: an owlbear, its beaked face looming out of the darkness.*
Owlbear: What's this? Something weak, something tender... || [context] NodeContext: Sizing up the player.
Owlbear: Won't even have to chew you before I feed you to my son, softmeat.
Player: Sorry - wrong cave. I'll be going.
Owlbear: I don't think so. You've seen my nest. You've seen my cub.
Owlbear: That makes you dangerous. An easy meal.
Owlbear: The meat tastes better when it's afraid.
Player: Let me go, or you'll watch your cub die before I finish you. || [context] InternalNodeContext: Tagged for non-barbarians
: False
Owlbear: I'll tear you in half before you touch a feather on his head. || [approval] ["Lae'zel 1", 'Shadowheart -1', 'Karlach -1']

----- Session: VB_CubResolution_1P -----
Synopsis: The players comment briefly on their decision to let an orphaned owlbear cub live or not.

Player: Nature can provide for the cub. Perhaps it'll live. || [context] NodeContext: Reasoning decision to let an orphaned owlbear cub fend for itself.

----- Session: AD_HatchedEgg -----
Synopsis: The party reacts to coming across some large empty eggshells, from an owlbear. They may recognise the species, or may have already picked up an intact egg.

Player: Owlbear eggshells... an unhatched one would fetch quite a price... || [context] NodeContext: Speaking from knowledge or experience. The player recognises the egg they've spotted and the price that an intact one could fetch.

----- Session: VB_EnterCave -----
Synopsis: The player enters a cave that houses an owlbear - a large, aggressive wild beast. They might comment on the stench of half-eaten prey, or note that some tracks they discovered lead into the cave.

Player: That stench... dead owlbear prey, no doubt. || [context] NodeContext: Upon entering the den of a carnivorous beast. Rotting, half-eaten prey are strewn about. The player previously identified the beast as an owlbear.

Narrator: *The roaring furnace awaits an offering.*
Narrator: *A candy-sweet scent wafts forth: the sussur bark infuses the weapon from within the flames.*
Narrator: *The flames sputter away. The sword is complete.*

----- Session: VB_TakePlans -----
Synopsis: Player reads the blueprints of an incredible weapon.

Player: Weapon blueprints. They call for sussur bark...

----- Session: PAD_NatureCheckOutcome -----

Derryth is a bit gruff - she's a healer, but her bedside manner leaves a lot to be desired. She's also a very shrewd businessperson. She's in the underdark to get rich first and foremost.
She treats her business partner (Baelen) like he's an idiot, and pretends not to care about him, but in reality he is the most important person to her in the world.

Derryth Bonecloak: Seems the 'shrooms are letting in more people every day. || [context] NodeContext: Not friendly. She's got a real squint in her eye taking you in.

Synopsis: You come upon the myconid guards. They warn the sovereign of your presence telepathically, and it begins to speak to you. This should be creepy, hallucinatory.

Narrator: *You are swallowed by a chorus of turbulent music. Through one creature sing many voices: the harmony of an entire collective.*
Restless Myconid: ((*Sovereign. they have come. they are here*))

There's some reactivity depending on whether Baelen has returned to the bonecloak camp or not, and if Baelen recovered his senses by eating the noblestalk mushroom. The animal's observations reinforce that Baelen has been more amiable and gentle since his mind began to slip, and his recovery is not seen as a good thing by all.

Deep Rothé: Master sounds different, like old self. Angry self. Don't like. || [context] NodeContext: SWA line. Reproachful. A simple beast of burden senses his master has returned to a crueler demeanour.

Omeluum: I greet you, sun child.
Player: How do you survive? Don't you need... brains?
Omeluum: In the beginning, I had an arrangement with a lich. Excellent company, despite what one would expect.
Omeluum: I required brains, he required souls. A perfect symbiosis.
Omeluum: But our ambitions eventually splintered. I wished to better the world, and he preferred its rot.
Omeluum: So I left his company, and thus I now feed from those who... act against the Society's goals.
Player: That's disgusting. You're a monster.
Omeluum: I cannot change my appetites. Although I am experimenting in reducing them with magic.
Omeluum: Perhaps with time, it can be one brain a year instead of one a month...
Omeluum: I greet you, sun child.
Player: There's no trusting a mind flayer. Attack. || [approval] ["Lae'zel 1"]
Omeluum: How disappointing.

 The top block: The borroding myconid is with the other myconids. You can recruit it.

The middle block: You have killed the lone duergar. the myconid now wants you to kill all the duergars.

 Next block: you have killed all the duergars; now it wants you to kill the sovereign
. 
Final block: you have killed the sovereign and it rewards you. 

This myconid does not speak with the same hive mind voice of the others. He should sound creepy, like FART in Rick and Morty, with a SLIGHT undercurrent of menace.

 As the quest moves on, he gets more and more creepy and angry,

Sovereign Glut: ((*the tumour is excised. the duergar are dead*))
Sovereign Glut: ((*here, I break ground. from the dark will a mighty Circle rise. my song will fill the Grotto!*))
Sovereign Glut: ((*death-doer - the Grotto may sustain but one Sovereign. in the Age of Glut...*))
Sovereign Glut: ((*...there may be no Spaw. eliminate the other Sovereign*))

Session Sequence:  -> PAD_FoundChest -> AD_Searching -> AD_Freed -> PAD_TooHeavy -> PAD_Door
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Benryn finds himself faced with multiple crises in this dialogue. When the player finds him, he is frantic and coughing, trapped beneath a collapsed beam within a burning building. If the player rescues him, he frantically and desperately searches for his wife, who was outside when a band of goblins and drow attacked the inn they were staying at. Finally, if the player finds his wife's body, he is heartbroken - he believes her death is his fault, because of a silly argument that they had.

When players first encounter Benryn, he is trapped beneath a heavy beam in a burning building. If the player helps him escape, Benryn joins the party until they exit the building safely. Once outside, Benryn is in shock at the carnage around him - bodies of goblins and humans litter the inn's courtyard. He snaps out of his shock when he thinks of his wife, who was outside when the raiding party arrived. He pleads for the player to help him find her - when players do, she is already dead. Pointed to her body, Benryn breaks down - the weight of guilt immediately crushing him.The barbarian class will have advantage in a strength check to lift the wreckage off Benryn, however if they fail, they can try again with a higher DC. Failure the second time will lead to more debris collapsing and killing Benryn.
