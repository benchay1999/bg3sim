Lines play sequentially, each druid saying one line, then the next, etc.They're chanting at a normal to low volume. They're attempting to suss power out from the earth itself, but they're not forcing it out. There should be a loose rhythm to it (think Arwen from LoTR when she summons the river horses), but it shouldn't come across like a drum circle.

Nadira: You have good timing. Never been much of a fighter, so wrestling a bugbear would have gone poorly.
Nadira: But you're not here for heroics, are you? Avernus' stench is all over your skin.

Karlach: Oh man, a soul coin? Wouldn't mind getting my hands on that... || [context] NodeContext: Very interested but maybe downplaying her interest.

----- Session: 005 -----
Synopsis: Arron is a friendly, but tired servant to the druids in the grove. Unless the player is a druid, he would rather they don't linger, though he is sympathetic and will help them any way he can (by selling them supplies). He is happy to see a druid and to help them. He can be a little preachy.

Arron: Another outsider? This place has certainly become popular. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Arron turns around and wipes his hands on his trousers (he was standing at a table, with his back to the player).

Player: What about the people here?
Arron: We druids will be safe. As for those that took refuge here... well, may Silvanus guard them as they continue their travels.

L is shaken by the encounter and having doubts. M believes the punishment was just and is even inspired to do similar to the other tieflings in the grove.

2) Child escapes. M is frustrated that the child fled 'without punishment'. He believes the other tieflings will take this as a sign that they can be walked all over. L isn't so sure.

Marcoryl: What is Kagha thinking?
Loic: Stopping the ritual was the right thing to do.
Marcoryl: But to not even consult with us?
Loic: Are you the one doubting her now?
Marcoryl: O-of course not! But this was our best defence!

----- Session: 002 -----
Synopsis: A very condescending and somewhat objectionable druid servant. He believes the tiefling refugees hiding in the grove have brought chaos and would gladly be rid of them, even if turning them away would doom them.

Marcoryl: You may have won over Kagha, but I'm not so easily swayed.

----- Session: 003 -----
Synopsis: An elderly druid who would like nothing more than for the player to leave. Depending on what the player has done, he will be civil about it, but still incistent. If the child has died, he is openly hostile.

Loic: Shadow Druids... To think we were rotting from within. I'm sorry. I need a moment. || [context] InternalNodeContext: TODO: Add Shadow Druid Flag. Reaction for after the player exposed the Shadow druid plot. I don't know if he'll be part of the druids who fight alongside Sagha (I don't know if all pro-sagha druids do). But this works both if Sagha got convinced and if she's dead.NodeContext: They just discovered that their boss was being influenced by an evil organisation.

Synopsis: Nerela is wondering whether to sell a music box, the only memento she has of the husband and daughter who were killed by gnolls on the road here.

Player: Sell it? I don't think your 'little monster' would like that.
Nerela: No, she would not. Near screamed our ears off when my husband tried to leave it in Elturel. || [context] NodeContext: Rueful, remembering her daughter's tantrum
Nerela: We tried to travel light, but... when the gnolls found us, we couldn't... they couldn't run- || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Breaking down into tears as she tries to tell the storyNodeContext: Deep regret, breaking up towards end of sentence
Nerela: I don't... what else can I do? They say you need coin to enter the city. For bribes. || [context] NodeContext: Composing herself, trying to be pragmatic
Player: This isn't my problem.
Nerela: ... you're right. I'm sure you don't want to listen to my prattling. Sorry. || [context] NodeContext: Hurt but hiding it - she's just told you something heartbreaking and you've dismissed her trauma.

Barth: You better not linger for too long. Those goblins just aren't normal.

----- Session: RaidAdventurer -----
Synopsis: Age: mid-30-40s.
Female
Bio: Rough and working-class. A veteran of many expeditions, Remira is nonetheless shaken after a raid gone horribly wrong and trying to hide it behind bravado. She feels guilty for leaving a new recruit to die, but tries to wave it away and gets defensive if confronted over it. She’s sarcastic and casually racist.

Remira: Ah, the fighting foulblood. Glad to know one of you has a spine. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: She cleans her wound, a cut on her arm with a [cleaning cloth]
Player: I already regret saving your life.
Remira: Ah - bruised your feelings, did I? Excuse me if I don't weep - got problems of my own. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Finishes cleaning wound and puts the [cleaning cloth] away.
Remira: My arm's near hanging off after wise Zevlor left us to die at the gate.

Remira: Oh, very gracious of you. || [context] NodeContext: You're trying to be gracious and she's not having any of it.
Remira: We expected a soft job. Something to test the new lad, maybe, but not a bloody goblin nest. || [context] NodeContext: She's justifying her actions - they'd taken on a job that seemed simple but quickly got out of hand. People died and she's doggedly maintaining that she's the victim. More explanatory than whiny, though.
Remira: Most would've turned tail at the sight. But not Liam, no - he charged them, the stupid bastard. || [context] NodeContext: She's genuinely hurt at the loss of this recruit but projecting a knowing persona to hide it, as if his bravery is somehow a rookie mistake. Note of incredulity rather than laughing at him, as if he did something very stupid.

Synopsis: Auntie Ethel appears to be a charmingly roguish old lady selling potions in the grove. She is actually a hag in disguise. The player can explain what happened with the tadpole and Ethel offers to meet them at her home in order to 'help them'.

Lae'zel: Hello, petal! Need anything? Any lotions or potions? || [context] NodeContext: Cheerful and sincere. This is her second time meeting the player. Acting like they're friends already.
Player: I need help. I've been infected by a mind flayer parasite. || [approval] ['Astarion 1', 'Shadowheart -1']

: I've ne'er a potion or lotion here that could do it, but... || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Looking around, concerned as she tries to think of something. Shaking her head.
: ...yes. I may have something at home! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Eyes light up. Smiles. NodeContext: Hope and cheer in her voice. She sounds like she genuinely wants to help.

======== Scenario: den_prodigy ========
Session Sequence: Group -> AD ->  -> Sister
----- Session: Group -----
Synopsis: Three people are having an argument. Rolan, Lia and Cal. Lia and Cal are brother and sister, but the three of them have grown up together. They're young, talented tieflings who are heading to Baldur's Gate to start their lives and careers. Rolan argues that they should leave now and get to the city while they still can. Lia argues that it is irresponsible to leave their kin behind. Cal is stuck in the middle.
This is a passionate and fiery argument, both sides are convinced that they are correct.

Lia: Hells, we can't just leave. They're kin. || [context] NodeContext: This is the start of the dialog but clearly an ongoing argument. You think it's your responsibility, as a tiefling, to stay and help your kin. You're angry, voice is level but will soon grow louder, and utterly convinced that staying at the camp is the right thing to do.
Rolan: I'll not gamble our lives, our futures, on people who are as good as dead. We must leave for Baldur's Gate - at once. || [context] NodeContext: You're angry but your voice is level. You think staying at the camp is essentially suicide. You cannot believe it was even suggested. You and your friends have brand new lives waiting for you in Baldur's Gate - to stay at the camp is reckless and pointless to you.
Cal: Can we all just take a moment? Please? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Looking for one to the other. Stuck in between them, pleading. Hands out as he tries to calm the situation. NodeContext: Your friend and sister are screaming at each other in front of you. Light and easygoing tone as you try to calm the argument.
Lia: What's the point in blades and spells if we don't bloody use them? We should stay. || [context] NodeContext: Your voice is getting louder. You're very angry now. It's your civic duty to use the skills you have to help people. You cannot believe how selfish Rolan is being.
Lia: These people aren't fighters. We can help. || [context] NodeContext: Ibid.
Cal: Or yell louder. That's fine too. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Sighing as he shrugs. He knows neither is listening to him. NodeContext: Your friend and sister have ignored your plea. You know once they've started they'll just keep arguing until one of them gives in. This is almost said with a shrug and in a light, jokey tone.
Player: You should all stay. A single blade could make a difference. || [approval] ['Gale 1', 'Karlach 1']
: False
Rolan: No. This place is a death trap. Let us leave - immediately! || [context] NodeContext: Player has disagreed with you. You're frustrated and angry. You think it's ludicrous that anyone would disagree with you.
Rolan: Or would you deny your brother here his chance at fortune in Baldur's Gate? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Looking at Lia but gesturing to Cal. NodeContext: You know the argument is likely going your way and you're being a little bit of a dick here. You know mentioning Lia's brother is a guarantee that she'll give in to your side and leave with you. It's a bit of an underhanded move.
Player: You want fortune? There's coin in it if you stay.
Lia: You know, that money could go towards a spiffy new outfit for your apprenticeship...? || [context] NodeContext: Smile, knowing rolan will give in
Rolan: Zurgan. Fine. Give it here. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Generic 'taking' animation. Taking coin from the player.NodeContext: 'ZUR-gan.' Frustrated but giving in to the promise of going.
Rolan: If we survive, it'll make for a good story I suppose... || [context] NodeContext: Kinda sulky but accepting that you'll stay in the grove.
Lia: Thank you, Rolan. And thank you, friend. || [context] NodeContext: Warm and sincere. Directed at rolan and then player.

----- Session: AD -----
Synopsis: This occurs betwen Lia, Cal and Ronan. There are mixed ADs which occur - when they're arguing about when to stay and go, when they've decided to stay and when they've decided to go.

Rolan: We don't even know these people! || [context] NodeContext: Arguing with Lia. He thinks her suggestion to stay is suicide.
Lia: That doesn't matter. || [context] NodeContext: Rolan has claimed you don't even know the other tieflings. You're snapping back.
Rolan: Of course it does. You would choose strangers over us!
Lia: That's not what I said.
Cal: Can we stop shouting? No? || [context] NodeContext: You sister and your best friend are arguing and it's getting progressively heated. You're trying to calm the situation but you also know they're going to keep ignoring you.

----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: This occurs after the argument with Lia. If they're leaving for Baldur's Gate he's pretty relaxed about the argument and dismissive of Lia and her concerns. If they're staying in the grove, he's furious and is convinced they'll die here.

Rolan: I can spare but a moment - Baldur's Gate awaits! Oh, I can almost smell the city. || [context] NodeContext: Leaving for Baldur's Gate after a hell of an argument but isn't bothered. Excited to be leaving and seems oblvious to that fact that Lia is next to him, SEETHING.
Player: You're cheerful for someone about to abandon his kin. || [approval] ['Gale 1']
Rolan: Well, you're here, aren't you? You can help them if you want.
Rolan: I don't believe in sacrifices for a lost cause.
Rolan: We're leaving for Baldur's Gate. And we will make it.
Player: There's every chance you'll die on the road.
Rolan: Please. I can handle myself. It's others that are the issue.
Rolan: You are looking at Lorroakan's newest apprentice. || [context] NodeContext: Excited, Eyes light up. This is his dream. He believes he is DESTINED for this.
Rolan: Yes - that Lorroakan. The greatest wizard in Baldur's Gate. || [context] NodeContext: xcited, Eyes light up. This is his dream. He believes he is DESTINED for this.
Player: Never heard of him. Who is he?
Rolan: What? You don't know of him? I've admired him for years. || [context] NodeContext: Pride and awe in his voice. He's clearly imagining himself in the same position.
Rolan: Both his magic and political sway are forces to be reckoned with.
Rolan: Rest assured, the names 'Rolan' and 'Lorroakan' will be known to you soon enough. You'll see. || [context] NodeContext: Dismissive shrug. Stating this like a fact.

----- Session: Sister -----
Synopsis: This occurs after the argument betwen Lia and Rolan. Lia is still stewing after the fight. Opportunity to get to know her better and understand the group dynamics.

Okta: Best to fill your belly now - while we still can. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Holding the bowl out. NodeContext: Warmth to her voice despite the gruff exterior. She's obviously concerned about the player but is hiding it.
Player: This slop is beneath me.
Okta: See how you feel when your pack is empty - it'll be this or a handful of weeds. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Shrug as Okta pulls the bowl back towards herself. NodeContext: Player has rudely turned down your food. You're annoyed and offended.

Elegis: There'll be more coming. Goblins hunt in packs. || [context] NodeContext: scared but resolute

He was trying to get to the Noblestalk mushroom, but one of the stone ledges collapsed underneath him and he fell down. His partner Derryth (Dwarven Alchemist) is in the Myconid Village. Important: Baelan seems to have trouble keeping his train of thought - he loses track of his responses, changes the subject and generally seems out of sorts at times.

Derryth is a bit gruff - she's a healer, but her bedside manner leaves a lot to be desired. She's also a very shrewd businessperson. She's in the underdark to get rich first and foremost.
She treats her business partner (Baelen) like he's an idiot, and pretends not to care about him, but in reality he is the most important person to her in the world.

Derryth Bonecloak: Just leave me, I said. You've done enough damage already.

Narrator: *You are swallowed by a chorus of turbulent music. Through one creature sing many voices: the harmony of an entire collective.*
Restless Myconid: ((*Sovereign. they have come. they are here*))

Synopsis: A Deep Rothe that belongs to Derryth and Baelen Bonecloak. A beast of burden with a simple Speak with Animals dialogue. There's some reactivity depending on whether Baelen has returned to the bonecloak camp or not, and if Baelen recovered his senses by eating the noblestalk mushroom. The animal's observations reinforce that Baelen has been more amiable and gentle since his mind began to slip, and his recovery is not seen as a good thing by all.

Deep Rothé: Master sounds different, like old self. Angry self. Don't like. || [context] NodeContext: SWA line. Reproachful. A simple beast of burden senses his master has returned to a crueler demeanour.

 The top block: The borroding myconid is with the other myconids. You can recruit it.

The middle block: You have killed the lone duergar. the myconid now wants you to kill all the duergars.

 Next block: you have killed all the duergars; now it wants you to kill the sovereign
. 
Final block: you have killed the sovereign and it rewards you. 

This myconid does not speak with the same hive mind voice of the others. He should sound creepy, like FART in Rick and Morty, with a SLIGHT undercurrent of menace.

 As the quest moves on, he gets more and more creepy and angry,

Synopsis: STATE NODES - first half of dialogue, Thulla is in EXTREME pain, speaking in short, terse sentences.Second half - she's weary but recovering.Thulla is a member of the Ironhand Gnomes, a group of militant gnomish artificers who came to the Underdark to find a forbidden - and extremely secret - formula for runepowder: an explosive of awesome power.Thulla is a true believer in the cause - when her group was captured by duergar, she escaped but picked up a poisoned wound on the way. She's slowly succumbing to poison - initially vague and feverish. If we heal her, she's exhausted but straight back on task, giving us the job of freeing her people.

Thulla: Don't. || [context] NodeContext: Terse, through gritted teeth. Assumes we have ill-intent.
: True
Narrator: *Her condition is familiar. Poison, derived from a wild weed common to the Underdark.*
Narrator: *She'll need an antidote soon - most likely held by the poisoner.*
Player: What's wrong with you?
Thulla: Duergar... slashed me. Poison. || [context] NodeContext: 'Your kin' spoken with a terse attitude - she probably thinks the player's the same as the duergar who wounded her,

----- Session: SocietyOfBrilliance_MindFlayer -----
Synopsis: Omeluum is a friendly, neutral mind flayer and member of the Society of Brilliance, dedicated to improving life in the Underdark. If attacked, it will teleport away rather than engaging in combat.

Omeluum: Greetings. What knowledge do you seek?
Omeluum: I greet you, sun child.
Player: How do you survive? Don't you need... brains?
Omeluum: In the beginning, I had an arrangement with a lich. Excellent company, despite what one would expect.
Omeluum: I required brains, he required souls. A perfect symbiosis.
Omeluum: But our ambitions eventually splintered. I wished to better the world, and he preferred its rot.
Omeluum: So I left his company, and thus I now feed from those who... act against the Society's goals.
Player: Best way to deal with that sort of hunger, I suppose.
Omeluum: Perhaps the peoples of the Underdark will be less inclined to violence if they comprehend the cost, yes?
Omeluum: I greet you, sun child.

======== Scenario: for_dangerousbook ========
Session Sequence: PAD_FindBook -> Tome
----- Session: PAD_FindBook -----
Synopsis: PAD when you pick up 'The Necromancy of Thay' (DangerousBook_Tome.lsj). Character might have a sense that the book is evil or just be curious about what it might contain.

Player: 'The Necromancy of Thay'? Sounds ominous.

----- Session: Tome -----
Synopsis: The player finds a book on necromancy - from one of the Red Wizards of Thay. Once read, the book will be bound to whoever tried to read it. Some origins will demand you let them read it, while others will want the book burned. If you read the book, you'll hear strange, distant whispers. The more you read, the stronger the voices will become, and the greater the chance that you'll be driven mad.

Narrator: *The book radiates power, but the words you read in the Codex echo in your mind, guiding your eyes safely across the page.*
Narrator: *The once-indecipherable glyphs now feel dangerously familiar, promising unholy power to those who can take it.*
Player: Read on and wrest the book's power from it.
: True
Narrator: *As you parse the strange glyphs, you can feel the book resisting. Ghostly voices whisper at you from the dark - probing and fighting your mind.*
Narrator: *But your will is iron and you brush past these shades of the past, devouring every secret the book has to offer.*
Narrator: *You see now, life and death are malleable as clay, to be bent and reshaped by your will. By your power.*
Narrator: *But as you close the book, a nagging doubt whispers in your mind. What consequences will there be for calling the dead from their rest?*

======== Scenario: for_kidsgame ========
Session Sequence: PAD
----- Session: PAD -----
Synopsis: A faded children's game marked on the floor - tic-tac-toe or hopscotch, maybe. Different races remark may or may not recall the game from their youth. Planar or gith might not recognize it - assume it's code.

Player: Huh. Haven't seen that game in years. || [context] NodeContext: Karlach: Little sing-song to the tune of 'one, two, buckle my shoe'

======== Scenario: for_gnomegoblin4 ========
Session Sequence: AD_Leaving
----- Session: AD_Leaving -----
Synopsis: A band of goblins elect to leave the area where they've been 'playing' with gnome prisoner after the player convinced them to clear off, one way or another. One goblin beckons to a worg - time to head off.

Goblin Tracker: C'mon, blood-breath. Let's find you something to eat. || [context] NodeContext: Speaking to a worg companion, urging it to come along.
Worg: Fresh meat... scared meat... yessss. || [context] NodeContext: Worgs are vicious beasts but have a little more sentience than most animals, and are capable of rudimentary speech.

======== Scenario: for_courier ========
Session Sequence: Dog
----- Session: Dog -----
Synopsis: In SwA, Scratch speaks like a human. He doesn't have any kind of dog-like affectation, nor is he stupid - he's well-spoken, even when he's saying 'dog' things. Throughout the dialogue, he's stoic but heartbroken, deluding himself into believing that his master is not dead.We come across the corpse of a man being protected by his loyal dog, Scratch.The dog refuses to let us near the dead man or his belongings, forcing us to try and win him over (or else just kill him). We can use Speak with Animals to get further insight into the dog's perspective.
 If we cast Speak with Dead upon the courier, we can learn the dog's name and use this as an additional way to win it over.

Scratch: Keep moving, stranger. Quietly. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The dog sniffs his owner's corpse
Player: Who is that?
Scratch: I told you to go! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Snarling, turning to the player
Player: Peer at his collar.
: False
Scratch: What are you doing? Get back!

======== Scenario: for_gnomeworg2 ========
Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: A worg stands guard along with a band of goblins while they torment a captive deep gnome. If the player gets too close or interferes, the worg turns hostile. An exception is if the player is a drow - then the worg is cowed and servile.

Worg: No talk, only bite! Go to goblin leader for talk.

======== Scenario: hag_hag ========
Session Sequence: PAD_TadpoleDivine
----- Session: PAD_TadpoleDivine -----
Synopsis: This VB plays after attempting to get Ethel to remove the tadpole. She confesses that there's something special about it and she can't remove it.Will play on the player who leaves the dialog that reveals this fact, but characters can be fairly opinionated here since they are reacting to knowledge.Up to two characters.

Player: The tadpole was tampered with? That complicates things...
Player: Tampered or not, we need to get these things out of our heads. Let's find another way.

======== Scenario: hag_hagambush ========
Session Sequence: PAD_SidedHag
----- Session: PAD_SidedHag -----
Synopsis: This VB plays after saving Ethel from the two brothers of the sister she's holding captive. Ether disappeared in a magic puff, and she was acting suspicious. The players are reacting to her exit and discussing that there may be more to Ethel than meets the eye.Speaker 1 may have been the character who was in dialog for the scene with Ethel. Speaker 2 is another party member. However, since there may be combat, this setup isn't guaranteed and it's best to write this assuming everyone had a hand in the actions that led to this VB playing.

Player: Bloody way to end an argument. I hope we chose the right side.
Player: No point in debating what's already done. Let's go on ahead.

======== Scenario: hag_forestillusion ========
Session Sequence: 
======== Scenario: hag_gurhunter ========
Session Sequence: PAD_BetrayedAstarion
----- Session: PAD_BetrayedAstarion -----
Synopsis: PAD that plays if you decide to tell the Gur Hunter in the Swamp where to find Astarion (HAG_GurHunter.lsj).  You tell the Hunter where your camp is, the Hunter says he'll take Astarion during the night the next time you go to sleep, then the dialog ends and this PAD plays.Your companion reacts to your decision to hand Astarion over (speaker 2) and then you clarify/justify your decision (speaker 1)

Player: You gave him up? I wasn't sure you would.
Player: He's too dangerous to have around. We'd always be sleeping with one eye open.

Session Sequence: VoiceOfAbsolute
----- Session: VoiceOfAbsolute -----
Synopsis: Before entering the goblin camp, a scene triggers in which the party hear the voice of the Absolute, and experience a vision of its Chosen Three (Ketheric, Gortash and Orin). The voice orders the player to help the three find the Orpheus artefact and to seek 'the path of illumination'.If a party member in the group has the Orpheus box in their inventory, they take it into their hands. It glows brighter and brighter, and then the voice and visions stop.

Roah Moonglow: Till this crowd converted and started sending their captives to Moonrise Towers, at least. || [context] NodeContext: Correcting herself. Tone is rueful - some of her best trading partners have fallen to organised religion.
Roah Moonglow: No complaints, mind - I just sold enough smokepowder to cover the loss ten times over. || [context] NodeContext: Perking up - she still managed to make a profit. Always a bright side.

----- Session: PAD_AbsoluteHuntsBox -----
Synopsis: The party reflects on learning that they are being hunted by the followers of the Absolute for the 'weapon' they have - in fact the strange artefact that protected them from the mysterious Voice when they first reached the temple.This can occur after meeting with Dror Ragzlin or Minthara.

Player: They're seeking a weapon. I wonder if they mean that odd artefact...
Player: If that's the case, we've got more problems than just the worms in our heads.

======== Scenario: gob_aftermathtrader ========
Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: After Goblin Hunt Celebration night and persuading Minthara to spare their lives, player can observe Goblin camp being empty with only one goblin trader looting what's rest in the Festivities area.This is that goblin's dialog.

Glomp the looter: How you doing, pal? Looking for some odds and ends? I've scavenged all sorts. || [context] NodeContext: friendly, like a cheeky bloke at a market selling stolen goods
Glomp the looter: Didn't expect to see you grubbing around here in the muck and the leftovers. || [context] NodeContext: friendly
Player: Where are the rest of the goblins?
Glomp the looter: On their way to Moonrise, with her ladyship. They left me here to make sure we ain't left nothing valuable behind. || [context] NodeContext: friendly

Player: The druid Halsin is in here somewhere.
Player: Let's hope we find him in one piece.

======== Scenario: hag_hagamush ========
Session Sequence: 
======== Scenario: hag_hagspawn ========
Session Sequence: SurrogateMother_Dead -> PAD_FireplaceIllusion -> AD_HagSurrogateMotherStartScene -> AD_HusbandGrave -> PAD_AfterResurrection
----- Session: SurrogateMother_Dead -----
Synopsis: This occurs when Mayrina dies. There are multiple permutationinlcuding, but not limited to, you killed her brothers and/or her husband, she knows that one or more of these people are dead but doesn't blame you, you took her husband as a summon, and you know one of the brothers is dead but she doesn't hold you responsible. 

Sad and far away sound - except in parts when she knows you killed her family.

Mayrina: Get... away... monster... || [context] InternalNodeContext: Brothers dead, husband turned into summon, Mayrina knows this player killed brothers.NodeContext: Spitting with rage but also on the brink of tears. This player killed people you loved.
Mayrina: Get... away... monster... || [context] InternalNodeContext: Brothers dead, husband killed by players, Mayrina knows this player killed brothers.NodeContext: Spitting with rage but also on the brink of tears. This player killed people you loved.
Player: Why did you come to the teahouse?
Mayrina: Ethel... bring husband... bring back... my Connor.
Mayrina: In return for... my baby.

----- Session: PAD_FireplaceIllusion -----
Synopsis: This triggers near the fireplace in the hag's home. If you see through the illusion, you realise that there is a passage way behind it. Otherwise you just see a pleasant fire.

Player: Fireplace isn't real. What's hidden behind it?

----- Session: AD_HagSurrogateMotherStartScene -----
Synopsis: This fires between Mayrina and the Hag in the teahouse before the player has spoken to either of them.

Mayrina: You've a face on you that could turn milk, petal. || [context] NodeContext: Sing song voice - cheery.
Mayrina: A walk would cheer me up. || [context] NodeContext: You ask this tentatively. You're desperate to go outside but don't want to upset Ethel.
: Hush, now! Won't be discussing that again. || [context] NodeContext: Smile as you dismiss the girl's request to leave. Cheery.

----- Session: AD_HusbandGrave -----
Synopsis: This occurs above the grave of Connor, Mayrina's husband. It was written by the hag and is a cruel jab.

Player: 'Here lies Connor - beloved husband, and a tasty little morsel to boot.' || [context] NodeContext: Above a gravestone - a cruel jab.

----- Session: PAD_AfterResurrection -----
Synopsis: The player's found a wand in the Hag's lair and tried to use it to resurrect Mayrina's husband. Unfortunately, it was cursed and he only came back a zombie. The players reflect on using items from evil beings.

Player: Not quite the outcome intended, but I must say - the technique was excellent.
Player: The spell is cast - what's done is done.

======== Scenario: hag_hag ========
Session Sequence: 
======== Scenario: hag_swampexploration ========
Session Sequence: PAD_HeroGear
----- Session: PAD_HeroGear -----
Synopsis: A fine sword and feathered hat protrude from the bog. A successful passive Investigation check suggests that long ago a hero came here to slay something, but didn't make it past the first patch of soft ground.

Player: Sword and a hat. Wonder whose.

Session Sequence: Dead -> 
----- Session: Dead -----
Synopsis: We can speak to Gandrel if he dies - he'll hint at his mission to hunt Astarion on behalf of Maiden Fel. Separate options if it's Astarion himself speaking to him.

Narrator: *The corpse regards you lifelessly.*
Player: Who are you?
Gandrel: Gandrel... hunter...

----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Male, middle-age or older.Gandrel is a monster hunter we encounter outside the Hag's lair. He's pleasant, cheerful, and a little eccentric - but shows his experience and expertise when warning us about the hag. He's affable and unassuming, but shows moments of steel when discussing his quarry (Astarion). A younger General Iroh from Avatar is a good reference - someone who makes you feel good about yourself just by conversing with you.

Gandrel: Ah, a fellow wanderer. Forgive the aroma. || [context] NodeContext: Friendly - noticing a stranger, wryly apologising for the slight stench
Narrator: *You catch a waft of something foul - metallic and sickly-sweet.*
Gandrel: Powdered iron-vine. Most monsters will think twice before making a meal of me. || [context] NodeContext: Explaining the smell in the air - he's taken a foul substance designed to ward off monsters
Gandrel: An old hunter's trick - if you can't mask your scent, spoil it. || [context] NodeContext: Friendly, unassuming, as if what he's saying is perfectly conventional
Player: Whatever you're hunting, your stench alone will kill it.
Gandrel: Hah! A quick wit is rare indeed. Good manners, however, all beings can aspire to. || [context] NodeContext: We've just insulted him and he's absolutely unfazed. Second line is simply polite advice.
Gandrel: I suggest you find yours before dealing with the lady of this house. || [context] NodeContext: Advising with only a slight hint of admonishment
Gandrel: A sharp wit will serve you better, if you're to bargain with the lady of this house.
Gandrel: That is why you come to her lair, I take it? To bargain? || [context] NodeContext: Gently prodding for our story
Player: It's a teahouse - hardly a lair.
Gandrel: A charming sight, to be sure. But the prettiest web still has a spider sitting at its centre. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Shot of sign for tea-house here if possible.
Gandrel: Her kind have hidden among us since the first darkness - and their knowledge is matched only by their spite. || [context] NodeContext: Growing slightly grave - telling us of a great evil thing that is not to be underestimated
Gandrel: Know how to ask, and they'll share that knowledge. If you're fool enough to pay their price. || [context] NodeContext: Telling us the risk might be worth the reward - but is is a great risk
Player: I think you're mistaken - this place looks innocent enough.
Gandrel: That would be nice. I'd welcome a proper cup of tea.
Gandrel: But I'm not wrong. Take her lightly, and she'll serve up your eyes for appetisers.
Gandrel: I'll eat them, too. I need her knowledge - the thing I hunt has gone to ground. || [context] NodeContext: Only faintly apologetic - he wishes us no harm, but he needs the hag and her information
Gandrel: But she thrives on suffering. Once she hears what awaits my quarry when I catch him, she will help. || [context] NodeContext: Growing grave
Player: Any advice on how to deal with her?
Gandrel: Scream. Turn. Run the other way - that's what I'd like to say.
Gandrel: But bad as she is, I'm betting whatever drove you to her door is worse.
Gandrel: So instead: know you're outmatched. Know what you're willing to give. And mind your manners.

======== Scenario: hag_haglair ========
Session Sequence: Victim_003_PAD_HeartAttack -> Rudder
----- Session: Victim_003_PAD_HeartAttack -----
Synopsis: The Player has forced Lorin, the prescient victim, out of his corner in the hag lair. He begs Ethel for mercy, then clutches his chest as he dies of a heart attack - punishment for leaving his post.

Player: What just happened?
Player: The hag's doing. It has to be.

----- Session: Rudder -----
Synopsis: 

2960b273-d78c-4e7d-9f44-649be3bafbe1: |Vision-based dialogue for the rudder.|

======== Scenario: hag_hagambush ========
Session Sequence: Brother_002_AD_Fallback -> AD_Argument -> Brother_002_AD_BrotherDied -> AD_HagThankPlayer
----- Session: Brother_002_AD_Fallback -----
Synopsis: Player tries to speak to the brother while either the other brother is in the shared Brothers dialogue (and this one missed it for some reason), or because they're waiting for the hag to come back into the house and start her dialogue.

Johl: Hold on. || [context] NodeContext: You're in the swamp and want to keep moving. Gruff and impatient.

----- Session: AD_Argument -----
Synopsis: This argument is the beginning of the situation. The three of them are yelling at each other out in the open. The brothers believe Ethel has taken their sister, while she is denying any knowledge of the girl.

Demir: She went to see you. We know she did. || [context] NodeContext: Trying to calm the situation - you don't want it to get violent and you're also terrified of Ethel/
: You know absolutely nothing, you eejit. || [context] NodeContext: Said with a laugh as your shrug the accusations off.
Johl: Drop the act! || [context] NodeContext: Voice rising. You're getting more angry and you're tired of Ethel dodging your accusations.

----- Session: Brother_002_AD_BrotherDied -----
Synopsis: Occurs when Johl's brother dies.

Johl: Demir! DEMIR! || [context] NodeContext: Your brother has died in front of you.

----- Session: AD_HagThankPlayer -----
Synopsis: This occurs after the ambush. Player has sided with Ethel and killed the brothers. Player has either not spoken to Ethel yet OR they are wildshaped and cannot speak.

: Come here and let me see you proper, petal. We need to chat. || [context] NodeContext: Serious. Concerned.

Session Sequence: 002_PostEA -> 001_PostEA -> SpokeWithDeadCrime
----- Session: 002_PostEA -----
Synopsis: Wary and abrupt. Disguised as a noble paladin of Tyr, this young is actually in league with the archdevil Zariel. She's hiding out in a tollhouse with her companions.

Trynn: If you want to go poking around in the cellar, be my guest. Plug your nose first though. || [context] NodeContext: Turning her attention from a trapdoor to the player. With a smirk on the last sentence
Player: This is a nice place to hole up in. What is it?
Trynn: It was a tollhouse. By the time we arrived, it was more like a slaughterhouse. || [context] NodeContext: with a shrug - explaining a reality of the world
Trynn: There's more monsters than coin moving down this road.

----- Session: 001_PostEA -----
Synopsis: These paladins signed their pact with Zariel for riches and power and serve her with relish. They've agreed to capture and kill Karlach, one of the origin characters.

This cultist is the leader of the group. He's friendly, but badly injured after his fight with Karlach.

Anders: Our scouts told us you'd come. The devil's ally. Come to finish us, have you?
Player: You must mean Karlach. I know the truth about who you are.
Anders: I'm sure she's invented a fascinating history of our crimes. The truth is far simpler.
Anders: We are paladins of Tyr, Lord of Justice. He sent us after an infernal being, straight out of the Nine Hells, hiding in the form of a one-horned tiefling - Karlach.
Anders: She's slaughtered countless refugees fleeing the Absolute. Yesterday, she butchered an entire family. We were lucky to survive our encounter with her.
Player: You're a terrible liar.
Anders: First I was burned within in inch of my life, and now I'm stuck playing pantomime. I can't take it anymore. || [context] NodeContext: the mask drops; he reveals his true nature. not a suffering paladin but an agent of evil
Anders: Karlach is going back to Avernus, and if she won't go quietly, she dies. It looks like I'll have to kill you first, which I quite look forward to. Bye-bye.

----- Session: SpokeWithDeadCrime -----
Synopsis: A group of paladins react angrily to the player casting a speak with dead spell on one of their dead companions. They are angry enough to attack the player if the spell is repeated a second time.

: To arms! || [context] NodeContext: shouting to alert companions in nearby rooms

----- Session: CINE_RiderAndDragonLeave -----
Synopsis: Cinematic: Kith'rak Voss flies away on his dragon.The player interrupted the Gith Chokepoint situation.

[desc] CinematicNodeContext: ~The dragon spreads its wings and soars away.
NOTE: this could be used in a number of circumstances in which Voss flies away. Voss is an arrogant senior gith officer, focused on his mission, so he can always depart while being unfazed by preceeding events. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: ~The dragon spreads its wings and soars away.

While reading our thoughts, the githyanki may realise we are tadpoled, resulting in instant combat. If we manage to conceal our tadpoles, they may allow us to pass.

----- Session: AD_StandOff -----
Synopsis: A flaming fist solider nervously attempts to challenge a githyanki warrior. The gith is essentially an alien to the lowly soldier; he can't help but feel intimidated.
