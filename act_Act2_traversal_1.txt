Ketheric Thorm: There you are. As predicted. What is it, I wonder, that draws one toward death like a moth to light?
Ketheric Thorm: You could have run away. Absconded with the Prism - the one thing that could prevent me from fulfilling my destiny.
Ketheric Thorm: But the lure of one's destiny is irresistible, isn't it?
Ketheric Thorm: Perhaps you hoped to learn your place in history before you are erased from it. A bright flash of clarity before the snuffing-out.
Player: Why is the Prism so important to you?
Ketheric Thorm: The very fact of your being attests to its power - despite your infection, you resisted the brain, here in the heart of its domain.
Ketheric Thorm: What good is an army of thralls if they do not obey their master?
Ketheric Thorm: Let us speak plainly.
Ketheric Thorm: My Lord Myrkul gave me the one thing I desired - the one thing that no other god could grant me.
Ketheric Thorm: My daughter's life returned. Her heart beating once more.

Ketheric Thorm: He's never had a more devoted follower.
Ketheric Thorm: I have fought great wars before, in the service of other gods, and other powers. But for Myrkul, I would condemn all of Faerûn to death.

Ketheric Thorm: I will kill you now. And then I will raise you as my servant. || [context] NodeContext: Cold, merciless ire.

----- Session: ResonanceStone_PAD -----
Synopsis: The players react to gaining or losing the "Eldritch Pleasure" status effect from the Resonance Stone in the secret sideroom of the Colony kitchen/dissection room. This status is applied or removed upon gaining the "Eldritch Pleasure" buff bestowed by the aura effect of the Resonance Stone, and will only play once per user and nearby player. The removal dialog will only trigger upon losing the buff while inside a trigger near the Colony kitchen, as to avoid it playing unexpectedly during later parts of the game.

Player: I feel... glorious.

--- Scenario Details ---
======== Scenario: sce_wulbren ========
Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: This dialogue is peak Wulbren. If he's met you in haven (after you saved him), he rolls back on how rude he was as he realises the player would be an amazing asset in the city. If this is your first time meeting him since the escape (if haven is destroyed he waits out on the river until this scene in the epilogue), he realises how good the player would be to have on his side in the city and tells him all about how wronged the ironhand gnomes were.

Wulbren Bongle: You helped me escape this hellspit, then took down the heart of Moonrise - Ketheric himself. I'm impressed.
Wulbren Bongle: And I'm not a man easily impressed.
Player: I believe the words you're looking for are 'thank you'.
Wulbren Bongle: I was getting to that, but all right - thank you. || [context] NodeContext: a touch annoyed
Wulbren Bongle: Back in my cell, I didn't tell you everything - about who I was, and more importantly, who I represent. || [context] NodeContext: sincere
Wulbren Bongle: I am Wulbren Bongle, leader of the Ironhand Gnomes. No doubt you've heard of us? || [context] NodeContext: said with immense pride
: False
Narrator: *You recall stories of the Ironhand Gnomes - a talented group of inventors who were banished from Baldur's Gate.*
Player: Go on. I'm sure you're dying to tell me all about the Ironhand Gnomes.
Wulbren Bongle: We are inventors of the highest order, matched, perhaps, but never surpassed by the Gondians at the High House of Wonders.
Wulbren Bongle: But our forebears were foolish - complicit with Sarevok's madness over a century past, and so we were banished. Still are to this day.
Player: Pity he never succeeded. || [approval] ['Astarion 1']
Wulbren Bongle: You agree with such machinations? Duly noted.
Wulbren Bongle: I've fought tooth and nail to restore our reputation. Particularly against Gondian detractors who live in glass houses.
Wulbren Bongle: I've filled appeals - pleaded with the High Artificer himself. They've refused us time and again. Now, however, I will make them listen.
Player: Were I a Gondian, I'd keep you out of the city too.
Wulbren Bongle: *Sigh.* Foolish and ignorant, like the rest. But you'll change your mind once you see what's become of Baldur's Gate, I have no doubt. || [context] NodeContext: determined and zealous

======== Scenario: sce_minthara ========
Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: After the SCE debrief, Minthara sits on Ketheric's throne and dreams of what lies ahead.

Nightwarden Minthara: You killed the dead man. I'm impressed.
Nightwarden Minthara: And now your path takes you to Baldur's Gate. I shall walk that path with you.
Player: I hoped you would - we make a good team. || [approval] ['Astarion 1', 'Minthara 10']
Player: And I'll never tire of killing their previous occupants. We make a good team. || [approval] ['Astarion 1', 'Minthara 10']
Nightwarden Minthara: Yes - although I wish we had collaborated on the killing itself.
Nightwarden Minthara: But I will satisfy my war-lust soon, for there are greater challenges than Ketheric ahead of us.
Nightwarden Minthara: It is clear, now, that he was not working alone.
[desc] 
Nightwarden Minthara: We must be free if we are to rule - and to be free, we must destroy this cult, and Ketheric's co-conspirators along with it.
Nightwarden Minthara: I know one of them all too well - Bhaal's blood-letter, Orin.
Nightwarden Minthara: To think I thought her to be speaking for the Absolute. I worshipped that woman.
Player: So it's personal? Good - let's take her down.
Nightwarden Minthara: You make it sound so simple. She is the Chosen of Bhaal, Lord of Murder, and one of the cult's founders.
Nightwarden Minthara: Indeed, she is the one who indoctrinated me with the Absolute's lies.
Player: You committed atrocities in the name of those lies.
Nightwarden Minthara: And for that I am sorry. I will commit all future atrocities for my own gain - and yours, should we stand together.

Alfira: Ah! A fellow bard. Sorry to ask out of the blue, but would you like to play together? || [context] NodeContext: cheerful and excited
Alfira: The kids have been really down - I figured a concert would cheer them up. Or distract them, at least. What do you say? || [context] NodeContext: sincere and excited
Alfira: It'd be like a private concert, just for them - they'd love it!
Player: Let's see what you've got. || [approval] ['Gale 1', 'Astarion -1', "Lae'zel -1", 'Wyll 1', 'Karlach 1', 'Shadowheart 1', 'Minthara -1', 'Halsin 1']
Alfira: Hah! Just try and keep up. || [context] NodeContext: cheeky and playful

Player: Here I am. What do you want?
Barcus Wroot: To talk about Wulbren, of course. || [context] NodeContext: Impatiently
Barcus Wroot: Who? Oh - right. Well, forget about that magungus. We have more important things to worry about. Like Wulbren. || [context] NodeContext: 'muh-GUN-guss' (hard g's).
Player: What about him?
Barcus Wroot: Wulbren and the Ironhand Gnomes are planning something dreadful in the city.
Barcus Wroot: They have runepowder. They have motive. We have to stop them.
Player: The city has more important concerns than a bunch of gnomes with a grudge.
Barcus Wroot: You're tired from your exertions. Who could blame you? Have a smoke, a wash, and a cup of tea, and let's regroup when you're more yourself.
Barcus Wroot: To saving the city - and my fool of a friend.

======== Scenario: glo_gatheryourallies ========
Session Sequence: 
======== Scenario: sce_umi ========
Session Sequence: 
======== Scenario: sce_halsin ========
Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Dialogue with Halsin in the epilogue of Act 2. In it, he reacts to the various states that could occur in relation to his desire to rid the Act 2 region of the shadow curse:- if you've already done everything needed to ensure success. he's grateful and seeks to remain with you on the journey to Baldur's Gate.- if the curse is not yet sure to be lifted, but there's still something that can be done (ie Thaniel was saved from the Shadowfell, but hasn't been fully restored), he will implore the players to help and offer to join them.- if it's no longer possible to lift the curse, Halsin is sad and resigned to staying behind to stand sentry over it. He will not be available as a companion in Act 3, and his story effectively ends here.

Halsin: I will miss you, my friend. Perhaps our paths will cross again some day, if the sun ever shines on this place once more. || [context] NodeContext: Resigned/sad. It is now impossible for the Shadow Curse to be lifted
Halsin: Out there the curse still thrives. I failed this place - now I must remain behind, and stand watch over it. || [context] NodeContext: Resigned/sad. It is now impossible for the Shadow Curse to be lifted
Player: The shadow curse was always your burden - not mine. || [approval] ['Astarion 1', 'Gale -1', 'Wyll -1', 'Halsin -10']
Halsin: Yes, and so it must remain. I wish you success on your path. Had things been different, I might have walked it with you. || [context] NodeContext: Resigned/sad. It is now impossible for the Shadow Curse to be lifted

======== Scenario: sce_cursedfist ========
Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: This covers arts three states 1) Thaniel is dead, which means the curse cannot be lifted [he is heartbroken and grieving] 2) the curse quest is in progress, and Thaniel hasn't been saved yet [he's worried for thaniel and frantic] and 3) curse has been lifted and Thaniel is safe [Art is grateful and contemplative, but also a little reserved - he knows he's going to die soon]

Art Cullagh: When Duke Eltan formed the Flaming Fist, he sought out people of courage and honour to fill its ranks.
Art Cullagh: You saved Thaniel, lifted the curse, and killed an immortal.
Art Cullagh: It's safe to say, you'd have been recruited in an instant.
Player: The Flaming Fist are nothing but mercenaries now. Immoral ones at that.
Art Cullagh: Maybe. I don't know what this Duke Ravengard is like.
Art Cullagh: But the Flaming Fist are the cornerstone of the city, and the Dukes are the foundation.
Art Cullagh: I hope you can save Duke Ravengard - for the good of Baldur's Gate.
Player: Come with me - I could use a Flaming Fist by my side.
Art Cullagh: Thank you, but look at me - I am a relic: a glimpse of history barely strong enough to stand on his own two feet.
Art Cullagh: Besides - Thaniel should have someone here when he wakes up. It's the least I can do.
Player: Then I wish you luck. Thank you for your help. || [approval] ['Gale 1', 'Wyll 1', 'Karlach 1', 'Halsin 1']
Art Cullagh: You too, my friend. Thank you - from Thaniel and I.

Withers: The shadows yet fester. The Dead Three, united under cover of darkness. The balance shifts.
: True
Narrator: *The Dead Three. Myrkul, Bane, and Bhaal - lords of deathly tenets, and traitors to Ao, god of gods.*
Narrator: *All three sowed chaos at the height of their power. And all three now walk the planes as mortals - or so it's believed.*
Withers: There are depths to this alliance yet unplumbed. Consider, mortal:

Player: Forget that. Who are you? What are you doing here?
Withers: I shall ask yet again. Do illithids possess souls?

----- Session: AD_EpilogueIntro -----

--- Scenario Details ---
======== Scenario: hav_molsdeal ========
Session Sequence: Lanceboard_AD -> AD_MonitorLeave -> Raphael -> AD_NoticedStolenBoard
----- Session: Lanceboard_AD -----
Synopsis: ADs for Mol and Raphael as they play lanceboard. Mol is pretending to be unskilled and disinterested in the game.

Mol: This game's awful. Why's anyone play it? || [context] NodeContext: pretending to be bad at the game (she's actually amazing at it)
Raphael: It hones a strategic mind, my dear. Take your turn.
Mol: Ugh. || [context] NodeContext: pretending to be bad at the game (she's actually amazing at it)

----- Session: AD_MonitorLeave -----
Synopsis: AD spoken by Raphael as he stands to leave after playing chess with Mol.

Raphael: If you'll excuse me, I must see to urgent matters.
Raphael: But don't you fret. I shall always find time for my most treasured acquaintance.

----- Session: Raphael -----
Synopsis: If Mol is dead or not present for other reasons, this solo dialogue for Raphael will take place instead.Rather than sitting at the lanceboard table, he is looming in the corner observing everyone else in Last Light.

Raphael: It's good to see you again. I'd ask if you've made any progress with your little problem, but the tell-tale twitching of your eye is answer enough. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Raphael turns to the player and smiles.
Player: You again - I'm sure your arrival is simply a coincidence.
Raphael: My dear, nothing is coincidence. Mortals trifle themselves with free will, as if their betters have not moulded every potential path ahead.
Raphael: No offence meant, of course. I'm sure everyone in Last Light thinks they could have changed things.
[desc] 
Raphael: They're not the only ones ripe for temptation, you know. My last contract here fed me for decades.
Player: You were here before? Why?
Raphael: Family troubles. Not my family, of course.

----- Session: AD_NoticedStolenBoard -----
Synopsis: Mol reacts to the player having stolen and put the lanceboard elsewhere.

Mol: Huh. Just put this away a second ago... didn't I?

======== Scenario: hav_florrick ========
Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Florrick is with her Flaming Fist troops in Haven. As you approach, they are furiously trying to put a plan together to rescue Ravengard. The curse is one thing, but Ketheric is invincible. They can't just storm the place. And even if they could, they would execute the prisoners if the alarm was raised - including the Grand Duke.Florrick turns to you, incredibly grateful that we have made it so far. She implores you to work with Jaheira for her rescue efforts, but tells you your priority is clear: Duke Ravengard. He must be returned to the city - it will not survive his absence.

Counsellor Florrick: That eye. In Tymora's name, Wyll? What's happened to you?
Counsellor Florrick: That eye. In Tymora's name, Wyll? What's happened to you? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Addressed to playerNodeContext: Notices player suddenly. HAnd to brow in exasperation.

Counsellor Florrick: Gods, please, no. You were supposed to be my wildcard. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Addressed to playerNodeContext: Notices player suddenly. HAnd to brow in exasperation.
Counsellor Florrick: We believe the cultists have taken Duke Ravengard to Moonrise Towers. I don't suppose you've found a way in?
Counsellor Florrick: I don't suppose you've found a way into the Towers?
Player: What's with the fellow in the cot?
Counsellor Florrick: Isobel cleared this place, and he just... appeared. We think he was staying at the inn when the curse fell - which means he's been trapped inside for a century.
Counsellor Florrick: It beggars belief he's alive at all.
Counsellor Florrick: Hopefully he'll come 'round. Tell us something useful about getting through the shadows. Right now he seems to have little more to him than a refrain from some song or other.
Player: What can you tell me about Isobel?
Counsellor Florrick: Cleric of Selûne - she's got a room upstairs if you want to meet her. Just don't interrupt her while she's doing whatever it is that keeps this place shadow-free.

Player: My blood... it's telling me to kill you.
Isobel: And yet you hesitate. || [context] NodeContext: Suspicious, hardened voice
Narrator: *She doesn't believe you will do it. You can see, she wants to believe there is mercy in all, even in the worst.*

Narrator: *The Urge within does not want to talk. The restless Urge starts to scream.*

----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Cerys, a tiefling scout, is now present in Last Light along with the others who evaded capture by the cultists. She has reluctantly assumed the role of leader in Zevlor's absence (assuming she hadn't already). She's exhausted by the responisibility but still capable of a little gallows humour.

Cerys: Thought you'd be ten yards tall, the way Zevlor spoke of you. || [context] InternalNodeContext: Protected state. Barrier is On, nothing bad happened yet. Met.NodeContext: Blunt, eyeing us up (friendly, not unimpressed - but muted due to circumstances)
Cerys: Cerys. Scout. Seems we missed one another at the grove, but the others told me how you helped us.
Cerys: A pity. You pulled them from one death-trap only for me to land them in this one. || [context] NodeContext: Sighing, looking around at the inn. She's exhausted and guilty in equal measure.
Player: The inn is old, but 'death-trap' is a bit much.
Cerys: Glad you've kept your humour. The others could use it - what's left of us. || [context] NodeContext: Smiling at our joke - less at the content than the fact we can joke at all.
Cerys: Aye, and more than half the others with him.
Cerys: We were ambushed out in the cursed lands - cultists of this Absolute. Likely we should have surrendered, but...
Cerys: They were toying with us. Making examples. And we'd had enough of taking it.
Cerys: Those of us who cut free just kept running 'til we found this place. The others... maybe the cult got them. Maybe the curse. || [context] NodeContext: Shrugging, helpless. It's not that she doesn't care what happened to them, but she's exhausted and knows there's little she can do
Player: What are you doing out here to begin with? You were bound for Baldur's Gate.
Cerys: This army of the Absolute is growing, and flowing towards Moonrise. There's worse than goblins on the roads now. || [context] NodeContext: Ominous, frustrated. They met much more resistance than she imagined
Cerys: I thought we might pass unnoticed along the fringes of this place. Escape the owlbear by hiding in its shadow, so to speak.
Cerys: You can see exactly how well that went. || [context] NodeContext: Making light of her own foolish plan. Not jokey, just tired - her failure is self-evident
Player: Sounds like you made a right mess of things. || [approval] ['Astarion 1', 'Gale -1', 'Karlach -1', "Lae'zel 1", 'Shadowheart 1', 'Minthara 1', 'Wyll -1', 'Halsin -1']
Cerys: Aye, I did. Maybe you'd have been the one to save us all, if you'd been there. || [context] NodeContext: No pretense - she openly accepts she abandoned some people, but has to be pragmatic.
Cerys: Or maybe you'd be missing along with the rest. || [context] NodeContext: Stark - not trying to provoke or insult us, just stating facts

Jaheira: I led them here - to this. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: (Cine) On ‘to this' she waves her arm signalling the carnage all around.
Player: Get a grip. This isn't over yet.
Jaheira: After such carnage you'd persist? Sometimes there's folly in such courage.
Player: Then by all means I'm a fool. But I'm not giving up.
Jaheira: Perhaps it's right that you're not. You're twice blessed after all: by Isobel and by your artefact. But as for myself, I don't see another option than to make a desperate dash back to Baldur's Gate.
Jaheira: Chances are slim I'd survive the journey back, but if I can warn the dukes an army of Absolutists is on the march, perhaps the city still stands a fighting chance.
Player: In that case, good luck and godsspeed.
Jaheira: Thank you, truly. May you succeed where I have failed. You are the stuff of legends now. Pray that I live to tell your tale.
Jaheira: Farewell.

Ide: Mol would do the same for any of us. You know it. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Kids are talking amongst themselves. NodeContext: Determined. Ide would die for Mol. Arguing everyone should leave and save her.
Umi: But how do we get into Moonrise? We can't fight those shadow things. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Kids are talking amongst themselves. NodeContext: Afraid. Trying to be the voice of reason.

He doesn't feel like a hero though - he feels like a failure.

======== Scenario: hav_halsinquest ========
Session Sequence: Portal
----- Session: Portal -----
Synopsis: After the player acquires Art's instrument from the Surgeon, and speaks to Art, Halsin is able to use information given by Art to navigate through the Shadowfell, with the intention of recuing Thaniel, the spirit of the land, and ultimately lifting the shadow curse. He asks the player to help him by protecting a portal to the Shadowfell until he can return with Thaniel. He waits by the shore a short distance from Last Light. Once Halsin enters the portal and the dialogue ends, shadow creatures attack. The player must fight off the creatures until Halsin returns. However, if the player attempts to go through the portal themselves, the ritual will fail.

Halsin: You're here, good. Now we can begin.
Player: First, I want to know what to expect.
Halsin: Thaniel is trapped in the Shadowfell, but thanks to your efforts, I know where to look. Now I must go there - alone. || [context] NodeContext: Thaniel rhymes with Daniel
Player: Sounds like you don't need my help anymore.
Halsin: Wrong. You are the beacon that will guide me home.
Halsin: With the Oak Father's blessing, I can infiltrate the Shadowfell, but doing so will sap my strength. I'll need your help if I'm to return.
Halsin: I need you to stay here. Keep the portal open until I return - and defend it at all costs.
Player: You can count on me. || [approval] ['Gale 1', 'Wyll 1', 'Karlach 1']
Halsin: Good. Now it's important that only I pass through the portal once it opens. The magic is fragile - any mistake, and our one chance will be lost forever.

Session Sequence: Skeletons -> Ketheric -> WaitingKetheric -> AccessCultist

Synopsis: Animated skeleton of MyrkulThe skeletons don' talk, they don't have the animations. It's doable, but should be thought through and requested, then the scripting will have to change too.

----- Session: Ketheric -----
Synopsis: Evil route. Captured Nightsong

Ketheric Thorm: I'll tell you a story, True Soul. About a man who sold himself piece by piece.
Ketheric Thorm: He had... everything. A wonderful wife. A brilliant daughter. They lived not far from here.
Ketheric Thorm: His wife died too young. Grief tore through their home like a thief, snatching away the scent of her hair, the rustle of her skirts. But the man did not break.
Ketheric Thorm: He could not break. His daughter needed him whole, after all.
Ketheric Thorm: She grew up - grew strong. Challenged him. Filled his heart with such joy it supplanted all sorrow.
Ketheric Thorm: When she was killed, the man... he tried to remain whole, but it wasn't possible. Do you understand?
Player: So the man fell to pieces.
Ketheric Thorm: The pain was unbearable. All-consuming. He decided he'd do anything for reprieve.
Ketheric Thorm: First, he sold himself to the goddess of loss. But the pain did not subside, no matter his obscene feats of devotion.
Ketheric Thorm: Then a new god came - a god who promised the man something wonderful: his daughter. Her life returned. Imagine it.
Ketheric Thorm: He would have to give everything: his body and soul entire. He did not hesitate. Not for a moment.
Ketheric Thorm: And the new god did as promised. The man's brilliant, beautiful daughter came back. She was whole - she was alive. But she despised the pitiful wretch her father had become.
Ketheric Thorm: Her hatred he could bear, perhaps, as long as she had another chance to live.
Ketheric Thorm: Everything I've done, everything I have built, has been to give Isobel that chance. And you, True Soul - you have squandered it.
Player: You brought her back once. Do it again.
Ketheric Thorm: I can. I will. But it is not without cost. Who will pay this time, True Soul?
Ketheric Thorm: I have no mercy left in me - but it is for the Absolute to decide your fate. || [context] NodeContext: Almost sarcastic, like a very annoyed child talking to their parent
Ketheric Thorm: Kneel at the altar. Now.

----- Session: AccessCultist -----
Synopsis: The Mistress of Souls won't let us pass into Ketheric's chapel until we've completed MOO quests. Her tone is vaguely respectful, but not as deferential as a True Soul is used to. When we press her on this, we'll see her contempt - True Souls might be a big deal out in the world, but not here. In truth, she is a Myrkul cultist playing her role in the church of the Absolute, secretly contemptuous of every true believer.

Radija: It is not your time yet, blessed one. || [context] NodeContext: Looking us up and down, unimpressed but (barely) polite. Main note for entire dialogue is a customer service worker who knows they have to be polite, but secretly hates you.
Radija: The rooftop chapel is reserved for the General's private contemplation - save for those he chooses to ascend. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Shot of the doorsNodeContext: Polite facade, but secretly enjoying telling us we're not so special
: This must be the place. We have to get inside.

Raphael: There is a stage down in the dark upon which a great drama has suspended itself in time.
Raphael: Its actors dwell there still, mired in the languor of their long-tired scenes.

Raphael: Chances are many more graves than yours alone will soon be fed.
Player: Enough of your jibber-jabber. Begone.
Raphael: As you wish.
