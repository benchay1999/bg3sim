            "AD_Whispers": "While walking through Colony, the Elder Brain will whisper to you. The whispers are cued at specific triggers around the Colony, and will play only once. This AD can play anywhere in the Colony, except the Ketheric Showdown chamber and the hallway approaching it.Consider these ADs like a psychic intercom, the Elder Brain communicating with minions inside the Colony (thralls, illithids and Myrkulites alike). Most of the time, it will use its \"Voice of the Absolute\" to issue commands or rile up the troops, but sometimes the illithid side of the Elder Brain will slip through the cracks and address you, the player, directly, asking you to come and save it from the dominion of the Chosen Three.This AD is repeated on a timer, and will select the next available branch in sequence. The Logical Names of the greeting nodes refer to the areas in which these flags can be triggered, those areas being UPPER (upper floor)/LOWER (lower floor)/NEARBY (near the Ketheric Showdown chamber). ANY nodes can always be selected in any area.To only see a certain branch in the appropriate area, use the InArea flags, but make sure to add an additional greeting node without InArea flags that jumps to the next greeting node in the sequence, to prevent the AD sequence from getting stuck. Note that NEARBY and LOWER can overlap, so if you want something for lower only, make sure that InArea_Nearby is unchecked.The sequential selection of nodes is done using local flags and binary combinations of those flags.Any controlled player will be randomly selected for this AD, if they are available for dialog.These ADs play in random locations around the player upon whom the AD is played (use the COL_ElderBrainADs_Event_TeleportSpeaker flag on the upcoming speaker in a logic node for this, except for the greeting node).",

Her main dialogue occurs with her in a cell and speaking to the player on the other side of the bars.

He has the lazy charm of arrogant and the determination and cunning of the leader of a revolution. In this dialogue he offers you the main quest - to free him and the tieflings from the prison. He can speak to you through the bars - either with the player in prison, OR with the player speaking to them from the outside. NOTE: Wulbren pushes hard to charm the player and make them think they're friends. He keeps the friendly and charming mask on tight (dropping it only when he insults the player). We can have the lightest touch of menace in this dialogue, a hint that he's holding something back or that there is more to this than it seems, but it should be a light touch. He is friendly and charming here (the mask will drop back at Haven when he is rescued).",
