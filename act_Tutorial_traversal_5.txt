----- Session: PAD_Sign_001 -----
Synopsis: Started when passing an arcana check to discern the meaning of the sigil on the mind-draining machine above its respective lever. In this case it turns the mind slaves hostile.

Player: 'Aggression'. || [context] NodeContext: Player can decipher the meaning of the lever

----- Session: PAD_PodStorage -----
Synopsis: If the gith guide is not present, player will comment on the mass mindflayer pod storage upon entering the room.

Player: How many are there? || [context] NodeContext: In awe and disgust. Each is for a victim like you.

Synopsis: Player notices the victims are not responsive. Their minds have been drained.

Narrator: *The man isn't dead, but he's totally unresponsive.*

----- Session: PAD_ControlPanel -----
Synopsis: Player remarks on levers in a room. Not sure what the levers might initiate.

Player: Mind flayer machinery. Better watch what I touch. || [context] NodeContext: Wary

----- Session: PAD_ChairWhispers -----
Synopsis: This AD triggers when players decide to sit on one of the chairs in the mindflayer room. The idea is that they hear voices from the nautiloid as if it was communciating with them.

Player: I hear something. Voices.
Player: I don't hear anything.
Player: It's the chair - it's connected to the ship. And the ship's connected to the mind flayers.

----- Session: PAD_FreedSlavesDead -----
Synopsis: The player tried to free some mindflayer thralls, but they're already dead

Player: Already dead.

----- Session: ShadowheartFollower -----
Synopsis: Shadowheart's default dialogue while she's following the player during the tutorial. They've only just met, but given the dangerous situation they're in, there isn't much time for chit-chat.

Shadowheart: You're keen to chat, for someone in mortal peril. What's the matter? || [context] NodeContext: Dry, slightly terse at being interrupted again (this is the second or subsequent time the player's stopped to talk while they're still in danger).
Shadowheart: Something the matter? Besides the obvious, that is. || [context] NodeContext: 'the obvious' being that they're trying to escape a nautiloid flying through hell.
Player: Any suggestions for how to proceed?
Shadowheart: Well, jumping overboard is hardly an option - so that leaves us with taking control of this ship. || [context] NodeContext: To the point and practical.
Shadowheart: Provided we can figure out how to do that, of course...

----- Session: AD_HostileUs -----
Synopsis: AD oneliner for when after players have antagonized Us in the nautiloid and fled, He will appear in the mindflayer room with the other intellect devourer. When seeing players again, he will say this AD while entering combat.

Player: A rune. But for what?

----- Session: PodGirl -----
Synopsis: Occurs if the player clicks on the first mind flayer pod with someone inside. They can attempt to free the captive - Shadowheart - but the magical runes guarding the pod prevent this.The player can leave her stuck, or try to find another way to free her. Via a skillcheck or via Shadowheart herself, they may receive a clue to examine the console next to the pod.

Shadowheart: You! Get me out of this damn thing! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: ~Shadowheart is pounding from the inside of the pod. The pod itself is covered in strange lines of silver, unlike the other pods (this is qualith)NodeContext: Urgrent, angry and desperate. She's locked in a coffin-sized tube aboard a crashing spaceship. She tries to get the player to free her.

Lae'zel: Fool. || [context] NodeContext: Disgust

----- Session: AD_PatrollingIntDev -----
Synopsis: AD when interacting with the intellect devourer that is patrolling between the mindflayer room where a human is in a pod and can be transformed into an illithid and the room where two other thralls are in chairs and can be killed or turned hostile by pressing buttons.The intellect devourer will recognize players as kin because of the tadpole, and without revealing too much mention how tadpoled people are being experimented on and turned into mindflayers.

Intellect Devourer: You are beautiful.

Player: Needs a key.

----- Session: PodLock -----
Synopsis: The player interacts with a console that can be used to free Shadowheart from her pod. In order to use it correctly, they must first insert an activation rune (or be a magic user who passed an earlier arcana check that provided a clue about the console), then psionically connect with the console and command it to open the pod.

Narrator: *Life flickers in his eyes, but he seems totally unaware of his surroundings.*

----- Session: AD_EmptySHPod -----
Synopsis: Narrator AD if players interact with the empty pod where Shadowheart would have been if she was an NPC instead of an Avatar. It should be a generic comment concerning pods and the situation players find themselves in the nautiloid.

Session Sequence: PAD_FoundInfernalMetal
----- Session: PAD_FoundInfernalMetal -----
