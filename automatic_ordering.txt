The following data is a list of names of "sessions" and some information of the story of Baldur's Gate 3. The sessions generally don't have to follow strict orders, but some should, since one session is the cause or consequence of another. Similarly, some sessions should be mutually exclusive i.e., cannot coexist due to logical reasons. Figure out these orders, if exist.
The input is a nested dictionary with the keys being the name of the sessions, and the value being a dictionary containing 'synopsis' that summarizes the content of the session and 'how_to_trigger' that gives information on how to trigger the dialog session in the game.  

Your response should follow the following JSON format:
{{
    "reasoning": <step-by-step reasoning in figuring out the orders and the mutual exclusiveness between sessions>
    "order": [
        {{
            'predecessor': <list of sessions that should come before the 'sucessor'>,
            'successor': <name of session having predcessors>
        }},
        {{
            'predecessor': <list of sessions that should come before the 'sucessor'>,
            'successor': <name of session having predcessors>
        }},
        # Add more order rules here if needed
    ],
    "exclusive": [
    # Example: ['SequenceA', 'SequenceB'] # Cannot both appear in the same path
    # Add exclusivity rules here if needed
    ]
}}

Please only include sessions that has ordering constraints or exclusiveness constraints.
