Player: Nobody sent me.
Sazza: You're not mates with the tiefs, are you? You need to get back to your own people before you go soft.
Sazza: The lady that sent me here's the cruellest drow I ever met. You could learn a thing or two from her.

Session Sequence: Group -> Sister -> Brother -> AD -> 
----- Session: Group -----
Lia: Hells, we can't just leave. They're kin. || [context] NodeContext: This is the start of the dialog but clearly an ongoing argument. You think it's your responsibility, as a tiefling, to stay and help your kin. You're angry, voice is level but will soon grow louder, and utterly convinced that staying at the camp is the right thing to do.
Rolan: I'll not gamble our lives, our futures, on people who are as good as dead. We must leave for Baldur's Gate - at once. || [context] NodeContext: You're angry but your voice is level. You think staying at the camp is essentially suicide. You cannot believe it was even suggested. You and your friends have brand new lives waiting for you in Baldur's Gate - to stay at the camp is reckless and pointless to you.
Cal: Can we all just take a moment? Please? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Looking for one to the other. Stuck in between them, pleading. Hands out as he tries to calm the situation. NodeContext: Your friend and sister are screaming at each other in front of you. Light and easygoing tone as you try to calm the argument.
Lia: What's the point in blades and spells if we don't bloody use them? We should stay. || [context] NodeContext: Your voice is getting louder. You're very angry now. It's your civic duty to use the skills you have to help people. You cannot believe how selfish Rolan is being.
Lia: These people aren't fighters. We can help. || [context] NodeContext: Ibid.
Cal: Or yell louder. That's fine too. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Sighing as he shrugs. He knows neither is listening to him. NodeContext: Your friend and sister have ignored your plea. You know once they've started they'll just keep arguing until one of them gives in. This is almost said with a shrug and in a light, jokey tone.
Player: You should all stay. A single blade could make a difference. || [approval] ['Gale 1', 'Karlach 1']
Rolan: No. This place is a death trap. Let us leave - immediately! || [context] NodeContext: Player has disagreed with you. You're frustrated and angry. You think it's ludicrous that anyone would disagree with you.
Rolan: Or would you deny your brother here his chance at fortune in Baldur's Gate? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Looking at Lia but gesturing to Cal. NodeContext: You know the argument is likely going your way and you're being a little bit of a dick here. You know mentioning Lia's brother is a guarantee that she'll give in to your side and leave with you. It's a bit of an underhanded move.
Player: You want fortune? There's coin in it if you stay.
Lia: You know, that money could go towards a spiffy new outfit for your apprenticeship...? || [context] NodeContext: Smile, knowing rolan will give in
Rolan: Zurgan. Fine. Give it here. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Generic 'taking' animation. Taking coin from the player.NodeContext: 'ZUR-gan.' Frustrated but giving in to the promise of going.
Rolan: If we survive, it'll make for a good story I suppose... || [context] NodeContext: Kinda sulky but accepting that you'll stay in the grove.
Lia: Thank you, Rolan. And thank you, friend. || [context] NodeContext: Warm and sincere. Directed at rolan and then player.

----- Session: Sister -----
Lia: Those goblins will rue the day they chose to tangle with this grove.
Lia: You and I will do some good here - I can feel it.

----- Session: Brother -----
Cal: Lia and Rolan would never admit it, but they'd take an arrow for the other. Also stab each other. Not sure what'll come first. || [context] NodeContext: You have broken up a fight between Lia and Rolan more times than you can count. You're tone is light and friendly as you joke with the player.
Cal: Thanks for cutting in - there might have been more than words if you hadn't. || [context] NodeContext: A big friendly smile - you are the most genuine of the group

----- Session: AD -----
Rolan: We don't even know these people! || [context] NodeContext: Arguing with Lia. He thinks her suggestion to stay is suicide.
Lia: That doesn't matter. || [context] NodeContext: Rolan has claimed you don't even know the other tieflings. You're snapping back.
Rolan: Of course it does. You would choose strangers over us!
Lia: That's not what I said.
Cal: Can we stop shouting? No? || [context] NodeContext: You sister and your best friend are arguing and it's getting progressively heated. You're trying to calm the situation but you also know they're going to keep ignoring you.

----- Session: Captive -----
Findal: Oh, thank you, thank you. I thought I was going to die down here. || [context] NodeContext: out of breath, words spilling out of him - he's just been rescued from goblins who were tormenting him
Player: I'm surprised the goblins didn't gut you on sight. Why didn't they?
Findal: They were asking questions - about a weapon. || [context] NodeContext: confused, he doesn't know anything about this
Findal: I told them - the only weapons here are the ones the foulbloods brought. || [context] NodeContext: anxious, with a shrug
Findal: I must tell the others what happened. Step careful - there are traps in these tunnels. And thank you again. || [context] NodeContext: frantic - he's still getting his breath back after being attacked by goblins, and is preparing to leave

Asharak: I'm not 'sir'. I was a doorjack in Elturel. || [context] NodeContext: 'Take it down a notch'
Pandirna: 'Yes sir'. || [context] NodeContext: Repeating what her companion was saying mockingly.

Lia: Another word and it won't be the goblins you have to worry about!
Cal: Enough! Both of you!
Player: Battle formation. Now.
Rolan: That's to say me at the front while the others stay back and do as I say?
