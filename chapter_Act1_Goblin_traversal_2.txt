Abdirak: Sweet child. While I enjoyed that, I'm afraid your reaction was... lacking. || [context] NodeContext: Voice low and intimate. Player did penance but did not react correctly. He regrets that the player does not get a reward (but he had a great time, which is all he really cares abotu)

Player: Never mind. What are you doing here anyway - looting corpses?

Sentinel Olak: Lookit, Klaw! Supper's here! || [context] InternalNodeContext: haven't met the guards yet, not drowNodeContext: Goblin's talking to his worg (big gross wolf). Evil character, not a nice person.

Player: I've never seen a pack up close - always wanted to.
Sentinel Olak: Be a shame if you came all this way without havin' a look. But I can't let you pass just like that.
Sentinel Olak: Celebratin' a raid, we are. You'll need to wear our war colours. || [context] NodeContext: Said greasily. He's playing a trick on the player.
Sentinel Olak: Nice dab o' this across the mug oughta do it. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: *He pointed to a steaming pile of worg dung at his feet.*NodeContext: Pointing to worg shit as he says this. Stifling an evil laugh. He's told the player to smear shit in their face.
Player: Scoop up the warm dung and fling it at Olak's face. || [approval] ['Astarion 1', "Lae'zel 1", 'Wyll 1', 'Karlach 5']
Sentinel Olak: MY EYES! YOU SHITEY FECK-SHITE! || [context] InternalNodeContext: Can flinging dung at Olek make him go blind for combat?NodeContext: Player threw dung in Olak's eyes. This leads to combat.

Sharp-Eye Sluck: Tribe? || [context] NodeContext: Greeting node inquiring - is the player part of her clan?
Player: Say nothing.
Sharp-Eye Sluck: Tribe? || [context] NodeContext: She gestures to himself and to you, as if to ask, 'go on, tell me, are you part of my clan?'

----- Session: Worg_002 -----
Small Klaw: Good smell. Pack smell. Smell like papa. Papa? || [context] NodeContext: Sniffing at the shit on your face. Quick, primal - as if looking for comfort.

Tracker Kirz: You... kissed 'is feet... || [context] NodeContext: She's in awe. She actually wants to kiss his feet as well, but doesn't want to let it show yet.
Tracker Kirz: What was it like? Just... just curious. || [context] NodeContext: She's in awe and a little jealous. She wants him to kiss her feet/to kiss his feet as well.

Tracker Kirz: That good? Ahh, you're lucky. I... I get excited just thinkin' 'bout it. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The goblin shudders, then turns to stare wistfully into space.NodeContext: She's in dreamland.

Warrior Trinzas: Oi! Ain't no party in 'ere - || [context] NodeContext: Sudden, barked - she's on guard duty and takes it very seriously, assumes you're a drunkard coming in from the party outside.
Sazza: Shut it, Graw. Olak cleared us - got a visitor for the drow, I do. || [context] NodeContext: As if at a yapping dog. Sazza and Graw have bad blood, and Sazza loves being in a position of authority above her.
Warrior Trinzas: My arse - what's a True Soul want with any mate o' yours? || [context] NodeContext: Disbelieving - to Graw, Sazza is the lowest of the low but has always had high opinion of herself.
Sazza: Private business, that is. Raidin' business. But if anyone wants a pisspot guarded, we'll call. || [context] NodeContext: Putting on airs - Sazza has been chosen to go out on raids, Graw hasn't, and Sazza's rubbing it in.
Warrior Trinzas: Just get your friend branded proper, right Sazza? Got better things to do th- || [context] NodeContext: Disgusted, dismissive. Trying to have the last word and claim a scrap of authority by telling Sazza to the player marked so she doesn't have to stop us again. Cut off at the end by Sazza's reply
Sazza: No you don't. Come on, then. || [context] NodeContext: Dismissive, bored, matter-of-fact. Snubbing Graw and sweeping past, addressing us to follow with the second line.

Krolla: Well, lookie here. Seems like you know your way around the course. || [context] NodeContext: Reassessing you - you've just proven yourself to be quite good at the game and she's patronising you
Player: Your rules didn't say anything about fire.
Krolla: Well who ever heard o' chicken chase without fire? We're not bloody amateurs. || [context] NodeContext: As if you're just being stupid now. Scornful - you can't play chicken chase without fire, keep up.
Krolla: Oof. Hard luck, mate. Told you it weren't as easy as it looked. || [context] NodeContext: As if announcing a goal in a sporting event
Player: Let's play again.
Krolla: That's the spirit! Now show me the coin. || [context] InternalNodeContext: Checking the bet because jumping to the betting nodes which can be shown to the players during the game alsoNodeContext: Loud, encouraging - but more eager to see your money.
Player: On second thought, I'm done playing.

Owlbear Cub: *Hroo-hoot!* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Looking aboutNodeContext: SFX only
Player: Kneel down - you won't hurt him.
Narrator: *You notice a shiver run through his feathered coat - fear, a desperate longing for the safety of his nest.*
Narrator: *But his mother is gone - taken. All that's left are these creatures.*
Player: Offer him your hand. He can follow your scent to your camp in the wilderness. || [approval] ['Gale 1', 'Shadowheart 1', 'Wyll 1']
Owlbear Cub: *Screech!* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Cub tilts head, considering player, then backs away and leaves.NodeContext: SFX only - do not record.
