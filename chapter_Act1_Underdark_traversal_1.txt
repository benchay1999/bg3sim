Player: 'Death-dark'? What are you talking about?
Skickpit: Shadows - thick as a duerro's skull. Sucks the breath right out of your lungs.
Skickpit: Go on up, if you fancy. Me? I'd sooner take a swim in the Darklake.
Karlach: Must be the shadow curse. I really don't think we should go wandering in without protection.

Morghal: Drugh no. The Twat-Soul caused a rockfall. Trapped tighter than a ring on a fat finger. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Player, his party and Greymon/Orgarth get off the boat.NodeContext: DRUGH NO = FUCK NO. "Droog" like 'good', not 'food'.

Player: These True Souls are my enemies, not my allies.
Elder Brithvar: Yet you got that Twat-Soul stench.
Elder Brithvar: If I didn't know better, I'd say a mind flayer shat a worm in your brain.
Elder Brithvar: Should split your head open and poke around in there if you lot don't pay up.
Player: All I'm going to spill are your guts. || [approval] ['Astarion 1', "Lae'zel 1", 'Shadowheart -1', 'Karlach -1']

Kirgrath: You owe - what's the word? Restitution.  ([6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])
Kirgrath: That, or - or I add your corpse to the heap. Which is it? || [context] NodeContext: Another slight hesitation.
