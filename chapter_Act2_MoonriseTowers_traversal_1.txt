----- Session: AD_Combat -----
Kar'niss: You dare? YOU DARE?! || [context] NodeContext: Furious, mid-combat

================ Scenario: moo_nightsongdeath ================
Session Sequence: AD_ZrellWaiting
----- Session: AD_ZrellWaiting -----
Disciple Z'rell: If so much as a rat crosses that bridge, cut its throat.

================ Scenario: moo_executionthrone ================
Session Sequence: PAD_Use
----- Session: PAD_Use -----
Narrator: *From this seat, Ketheric defied gods and raised an army for the Absolute.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Grand shot of Ketheric's hall over the player's shoulder.
Narrator: *It is not particularly comfortable.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Shot of player shifting
Player: Don't get used to it. One taste of regal power might have you craving more.

================ Scenario: moo_zrellbriefing ================
Session Sequence: AD_WithGuard001 -> FlamingSpy -> Ogre -> AD_WithCultist -> AD_WithSpy
----- Session: AD_WithGuard001 -----
Zealot Bennel: All quiet, Disciple.
Disciple Z'rell: All quiet? Do you suppose the Absolute's enemies are resting, soldier? || [context] NodeContext: Suddenly cutting, questioning - poking at her underling's complacency.
Zealot Bennel: I - no, Disciple. || [context] NodeContext: Taken aback at her ferocity
Disciple Z'rell: Perhaps you cannot find them - root them out - because they are your allies? Hm? || [context] NodeContext: Doubling down, demanding answers
Zealot Bennel: I - no, mistress! I  would never - || [context] NodeContext: Close to pleading - is cut off by Z'rell at the end.
Disciple Z'rell: Oh, relax and let me have my fun. This paperwork grows tedious. || [context] NodeContext: Chuckling, suddenly breaking tension. A cruel boss mocking an underling for 'not taking a joke'.

----- Session: FlamingSpy -----
Fist Marcus: My unexpected ally! The General was very pleased with Isobel's return. Don't worry, I told him all about you. || [context] NodeContext: genuine in the first line, but in the second he sounds smug (he totally took all the credit)

----- Session: Ogre -----
Glourik: Nah-uh. Stay out. || [context] NodeContext: Finger wagging, chiding like a child

----- Session: AD_WithCultist -----
Disciple Z'rell: Ensure that the Moonlanterns outside are maintained, too. The curse cannot be allowed to touch the Absolute's hall. || [context] NodeContext: A superior giving orders, just to assert her authority - fiery, dangerous, spitting
Radija: As you say, Z'rell. || [context] NodeContext: Pronounce ZRELL
Disciple Z'rell: It is Disciple. || [context] NodeContext: Sharp correction - and underling dared call her by her first name, not her title

----- Session: AD_WithSpy -----
Fist Marcus: I am free to do more for the Absolute, Disciple. Anything. || [context] NodeContext: A terse religious greeting - a better to an underling, annoyed to be speaking to a lower rank
Disciple Z'rell: Would you cast yourself from the tower-top?
Fist Marcus: Of course. I have the Absolute's wings to catch me.
Disciple Z'rell: Off you go, then. I've always wanted to try those ballistas.

================ Scenario: moo_kethetic ================
Session Sequence: DaisyAD_AttackImmortal -> DaisyAD_AttackImmortalRepeated
----- Session: DaisyAD_AttackImmortal -----
: He cannot die - we must find what gives him his invulnerability before we strike!

----- Session: DaisyAD_AttackImmortalRepeated -----
: It won't work - not until we find out what is keeping him from death!

================ Scenario: moo_oubliette ================
Session Sequence: PAD_HorrorScreech -> PAD_Entry -> PAD_ColonyComment -> CorpseMembranes_Dead -> PAD_Escape
----- Session: PAD_HorrorScreech -----
Player: Hook horror. Wonderful.

----- Session: PAD_Entry -----
Player: Every bit as disgusting as the first time.

----- Session: PAD_ColonyComment -----
Player: Look - there's something on the other side. No way through from here though.

----- Session: CorpseMembranes_Dead -----
Narrator: *The corpse regards you lifelessly.*
Narrator: *The spell's power wanes. You can ask no more questions.*

----- Session: PAD_Escape -----
Player: The stink of that place might never wash out. || [context] NodeContext: [Astarion - not impressed]

================ Scenario: moo_dridercaravan ================
Unexpected scenario result format.
================ Scenario: moo_docks ================
Unexpected scenario result format.
================ Scenario: moo_necromancersroom ================
Session Sequence: AD_Minthara_EnteredNecromancerRoom
----- Session: AD_Minthara_EnteredNecromancerRoom -----
Nightwarden Minthara: Balthazar's chamber. Digging through the offal is unappealing, but may be worthwhile.

================ Scenario: moo_audience ================
Session Sequence: Skeletons -> PAD_TownVista -> Ketheric -> AD_MumblingSul -> RoofTransgression -> AccessCultist
----- Session: Skeletons -----
Narrator: *You think you hear a whisper - but perhaps it was just wind draughting through a dull and empty thing.* || [context] NodeContext: Not sure if "draughting" is correct usage but feels good for this moment - creepy wind creepily sighing through a creepy skeleton

----- Session: PAD_TownVista -----
Player: This must have been quite a view, once.

----- Session: Ketheric -----
Ketheric Thorm: I've heard a great deal about you, True Soul. || [context] InternalNodeContext: NS captured but Isobel not captured
Ketheric Thorm: Indeed, I'd have thrown you off this tower by now if I didn't want to have a little chat first.
Ketheric Thorm: You've travelled a long way to make it this far. Lied. Fought. Killed.
Ketheric Thorm: I can only wonder: why?
Player: I'd do whatever it takes to gain an audience with the Absolute.
Ketheric Thorm: And yet Isobel - the Sel√ªnite cleric - is nowhere to be found. Z'rell instructed you quite clearly.
Ketheric Thorm: Who are you to defy the Absolute's orders? My orders?
Player: I brought you the Nightsong - just as you asked.
Ketheric Thorm: Half marks means you fail, True Soul.
Ketheric Thorm: The Absolute will decide your fate. || [context] NodeContext: Dismissive, like an extremely disappointed parent
Ketheric Thorm: Kneel before the Absolute's altar. Throw yourself at Her mercy. Or try to earn Her forgiveness by retrieving the cleric Isobel. Your choice.
Ketheric Thorm: Go on. Now. || [context] NodeContext: Almost sarcastic, like a very annoyed child talking to their parent

----- Session: AD_MumblingSul -----
Pilgrim Sul: Cleric of the moon, alas! Too soon for the Chosen.

----- Session: RoofTransgression -----
Ketheric Thorm: Curious. I believe you were told to wait.
Player: My apologies, General. Please forgive my intrusion.
Ketheric Thorm: It isn't for me to forgive one who so flouts the Absolute's will.
Ketheric Thorm: It is for me to punish them.

----- Session: AccessCultist -----
Radija: It is not your time yet, blessed one. || [context] NodeContext: Looking us up and down, unimpressed but (barely) polite. Main note for entire dialogue is a customer service worker who knows they have to be polite, but secretly hates you.
Radija: The rooftop chapel is reserved for the General's private contemplation - save for those he chooses to ascend. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Shot of the doorsNodeContext: Polite facade, but secretly enjoying telling us we're not so special
: This must be the place. We have to get inside.
Player: I've heard that those lucky few come back changed.
Radija: You are already changed, True Soul. Hearing Her voice is what brought you here. || [context] NodeContext: Nodding, but unimpressed by our pulling rank. She's about to explain that being a True Soul is not special in her eyes
Radija: But above, you will stand in Her very presence. Such an honour requires... more. || [context] NodeContext: A little passive-aggressive.
Narrator: *Her words are diplomatic, but her face betrays her true feelings: utter contempt, for you and all your kind.*
Radija: Disciple Z'rell has given you a chance to earn that honour. || [context] NodeContext: Fixed smile, a little patronising
Player: You don't believe I'm worthy.
Radija: I believe you will find your rightful place in Her design. Either you will ascend, or you will fall. || [context] NodeContext: Neutral - this could be reassurance or threat
Radija: And I find use for even the fallen. I hope that is some comfort to you. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Shot of skeletons standing guardNodeContext: Indicating the skeletons she's revived

Narrator: *The cult know you live, but believe you to be a thrall, with your mind erased. Best not be seen here without one of your tadpoled companions.*

Narrator: *Steel yourself, and venture forth.*

----- Session: PAD_SharranObservation -----
Shadowheart: There is nothing Sharran about this man. He has betrayed the Dark Lady. || [context] NodeContext: Quiet anger and disgust.

----- Session: Zhent02 -----
Yerle: Ain't looking to convert, True Soul. Gods mind their mess, I mind mine. || [context] NodeContext: Respectful but flat refusal - most Absolutists want to convert others, and she's pre-empting it.

----- Session: AD_Pilgrims -----
Pilgrim Taima: To stand this close to Her power... I never thought I'd make it.
Pilgrim Iong: I wouldn't have, if not for the lantern-bearer. To think the Absolute graces such a creature as that...
Pilgrim Farimorn: We are each of us threads in Her design. Even those we once called monsters.

----- Session: AD_BugbearThrow -----
Lann Tarv: I could hit a pixie from a hundred paces. || [context] NodeContext: congratulating himself on a well-thrown axe, while practicing

----- Session: BazaarStander_006 -----
Pilgrim Nalira: The prisoners below are gone, True Soul. I cannot understand why they would flee Her mercy. || [context] InternalNodeContext: The prisoners successfully escaped from Moonrise's dungeons (perhaps all, perhaps only one)NodeContext: Confused, hurt - prisoners in the cell escaped - she saw them as heathens her church was trying to 'save'

----- Session: BazaarStander_007 -----
Pilgrim Taima: I hear you've been summoned for an audience with Her. You will return changed, I'm sure of it. || [context] InternalNodeContext: The player has kidnapped Isobel and helped return Nightsong and Balthazar to Moonrise. The army of the Absolute is ready to march.NodeContext: Wishing us well - we're about to get our 'reward'

----- Session: Guard01 -----
Adept Furek: You should go through the main hall. Witnessing the General's justice is an honour.

----- Session: Bystander01 -----
Brawler Weneg: Heard a rumour some do-gooder stopped a horde of Absolutists from getting their hands on a load of druids in some grove.
Brawler Weneg: Whoever it was better pray the General doesn't smoke 'em out. Be a bloodbath, so it would.

----- Session: Bystander00 -----
Brawler Orik: You're the best True Soul I ever met.

----- Session: Guard00 -----
Adept Dorikel: I saw it, True Soul. The army. They're nearly ready. It's nearly time.
Player: And when the hour draws near...?
Adept Dorikel: We march to Baldur's Gate!

----- Session: AD_GoblinsListening -----
Brawler Weneg: Enough! Just leave the bloody True Souls to their business.
Brawler Wim: And what's to say that couldn't be us? They say the General rewards them as serve him well.
Brawler Orik: And what about them who hang around his door like a bad smell?

----- Session: AD_BazEntranceGuard_002 -----
Zealot Brinn: Another True Soul. The Disciple will want to see you - through the main doors.

----- Session: AD_Minthara_BazaarEntry -----
Nightwarden Minthara: Converts, pilgrims, mercenaries. They all seek power, but will find only death.

----- Session: Bystander03 -----
Pilgrim Sul: She sees everything we are, do you understand? There is no hiding from Her! || [context] NodeContext: paranoid, freaking out

----- Session: Bystander02 -----
Brawler Wim: We ought to head out now - burn everything between here and the city.

----- Session: AD_GoblinsAfterExecution -----
Brawler Orik: They bloody killed 'em. What now? Are we next? || [context] NodeContext: stunned, fearful
Brawler Wim: Not if you keep them lips clapped together. || [context] NodeContext: Low and urgent - hushing loud comrade.
Brawler Weneg: Quiet, both of yas! Ye're drawin' attention. || [context] NodeContext: Hissed in anger

----- Session: Zhent00 -----
Roah Moonglow: Ah, a new face come to bask in the light of the Absolute. How can I be of service, True Soul?
Player: 'New face'? We've met before - at the goblin camp.
Roah Moonglow: ...of course! Just before some godless lunatic purged the place of every innocent soul.
Roah Moonglow: A pity neither of us saw what happened.
Player: Careful. That sounds like an accusation.
Roah Moonglow: The guilty ear hears blame in every breath. But you're among friends here, True Soul.
Roah Moonglow: Look around. All manner of beasties united against the enemies of the Absolute.
Roah Moonglow: Quite a god to bring them all together. And quite a fool who'd draw their ire, hm?
Player: Drop the act. What are you actually doing here?
Roah Moonglow: I'm not the one putting on an act, True Soul.  Though I'd mind how well you mouth your prayers.
Roah Moonglow: Spend enough time in this place, and you might just start to believe them.
Roah Moonglow: But look at me preaching, and when I'm only here to serve. Anything to trade, True Soul?
Roah Moonglow: Ever at your service.
Player: Leave.

----- Session: AD_ZhentarimCrew -----
Yerle: You sure you don't want me to check those crates? Be nice to know what we're shipping. || [context] NodeContext: Picking up a topic they've clearly already discussed. Her boss is doing a deal and she doesn't like being in the dark
Roah Moonglow: Erna, remind your sister why I pay you both so much. || [context] NodeContext: Maintaining a smiling facade. Asking one of her bodyguards to explain to the other why they shouldn't ask questions.
Erna: 'Minding our business is our business'. || [context] NodeContext: Bored, reciting as if she's had to do it a dozen times before

----- Session: BazaarStander_005 -----
Pilgrim Farimorn: Blessings, True Soul. We're to march soon - thanks to you. || [context] InternalNodeContext: The player has kidnapped Isobel and helped return Nightsong and Balthazar to Moonrise. The army of the Absolute is ready to march.NodeContext: Awed by you

----- Session: Zhent01 -----
Erna: You trying to get me in trouble? || [context] NodeContext: Smiling but fobbing us off.

----- Session: Bystander04 -----
Pilgrim Iong: The Disciple has returned upstairs but... perhaps she'll still see me. || [context] NodeContext: Wants to go, psyching himself up a bit. Now he has his chance and he's a bit scared

----- Session: GnollMaster -----
Linsella: A moment, True Soul. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Mid-conversation with a gnoll, holds up hand to us as we approach
Linsella: You use a spoon to stir the soup, Barnabus. Forget the axe, my darling. || [context] NodeContext: Kindly - speaking to a favourite child that is none too bright
'Barnabus': *Soft hoot.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Gnoll tilts its head and nods.NodeContext: Gnolls make hyena noises - this is a soft sound of acknowledgement/comprehension. Tilting its head and nodding.
Linsella: Now! How can I help you? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Turns back to usNodeContext: Chipper, friendly

Player: Curious. I thought male drow were nothing but cup-bearers and foot-stools.
21fd5b99-56df-4c59-be68-ed1d2c8e2aa6: I serve no one but the Absolute. He trusts me. He honours me. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: His scowl tightens.NodeContext: Proud and self-serious

Zealot Klen: Very well - if the General wishes.

----- Session: Guard02 -----
Zealot Klen: Congratulations, True Soul. You'll surely be granted an audience - with Her. || [context] InternalNodeContext: The player has kidnapped Isobel and helped return Nightsong and Balthazar to Moonrise.

Acolyte Daine: Ugh. There's blood on these cards. || [context] NodeContext: After noticing some gore on her cards
Zealot Bennel: Aye. My brother's. Had to deal with him after he struck a True Soul - claimed she was some kind of monster. || [context] NodeContext: Mild, barely looking up from his hand
Zealot Bennel: Had to toss him over that terrace there. || [context] NodeContext: Only the vaguest regret - as if murdering his own brother was an unfortunate duty
Acolyte Daine: Gods. || [context] NodeContext: Mute shock at what she's just heard
Zealot Bennel: God. We belong to just the one now, remember. || [context] NodeContext: First edge in his voice. Firmly clarifying that he won't brook any blasphemy against his god

----- Session: Guard01 -----
Acolyte Kimmeral: Don't mind Mig and her 'meat sounds'. It's just her brain slopping around in her skull. || [context] NodeContext: Mig is an ogre complaining about 'meat sounds' - you are reluctantly sharing a room with the ogre, and explaining his weirdness away

----- Session: Guard02 -----
Zealot Iogar: You'd find better lodgings out in the war camp, True Soul.

Ketheric Thorm: What is your name, True Soul?
Player: What does it matter?

Session Sequence: Circle
----- Session: Circle -----
Narrator: *Carved into the bench's rotted surface are strange, half-faded sigils. A magic circle of some kind, thick with darkness and decay.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: A shot of the sigil on the desk. It looks dark, evil, unsettling...
Gale: A ritual circle... and a complex one, at that. I've seen such a construction before, in the writings of the Weavepasha of Almraiven, though his vision was not so... tainted.
Player: Is it dangerous?
Gale: It's inert, if that's what you mean. But it still reeks of the Shadow Weave, and its polluting magic will continue to escape for as long as it lies abandoned here.
Gale: The discarded pixie corpses might still contain enough essence, and with one of the broken lantern casements... || [context] NodeContext: Talking himself through an idea.Temptation building, he'd quite like to do this
Gale: Yes, I think I'd be able to craft one more lantern. And with a slight modification of the casting gesture, it might be able to wield the shadows instead of repelling them... || [context] NodeContext: Talking himself through an idea.Temptation building, he'd quite like to do this
Gale: Though... Mystra's eyes may be upon me, and she'd forbid me dabbling with such magic. She'd want it destroyed. Wasted, arguably. || [context] NodeContext: Coming back to himself after getting carried away, remembering he might get in trouble for creating the lantern. A hint he'd like you to encourage him to use it.
Shadowheart: Forget what Mystra wants - think about yourself, and what Lady Shar's power could do for you, Gale. Make the Lantern - spread her will. || [context] NodeContext: 'And rightly so' = SH turned from Shar. 'Forget what Mystra wants' = SH loyal to Shar.
Player: Let me deal with the circle.
Gale: Deal with it how? I hate to pull rank, but I was once Mystra's Chosen. Destroying magic like this was my bread and butter. || [context] NodeContext: Patient, slightly patronising
Gale: Or did you wish to use it? I assure you - it's pointless. You'll have nothing more than a sore head and a very dissatisfied wizard to show for it.
Player: There's a reason you're Mystra's former Chosen. So let me handle it.
Gale: Oh, charming. I hope the Shadow Weave was to blame for that little outburst of unwarranted discourtesy. || [context] NodeContext: Peeved
Gale: If you think you know best, go right ahead. || [context] NodeContext: Peeved, ready to let you mess it up

Player: What are the prisoners going to do? Talk me to death?
Narrator: *Your reasoning is hard to argue with. You're free to speak to the prisoners.*

----- Session: MintharaFate_SpottedWithMinthara -----
Narrator: *Minthara is supposed to be in a cell - you have some explaining to do.*
Player: I think she serves rather well as my personal servant, don't you?
Narrator: *The guard is happy to let you pass - Minthara is rather less happy about your choice of words.*

----- Session: AD_TieflingsFreed -----
Wulbren Bongle: Follow or die, tieflings! || [context] NodeContext: yelling with authority and confidence

----- Session: AD_TieflingInspection -----
The Warden: You're lucky, you know. It's rare that Disciple Balthazar takes a personal interest in prisoners. || [context] NodeContext: smirking as she speaks to her prisoners - cruel
Cal: You know, the rest I can understand, but you're one of us. || [context] NodeContext: hurt and betrayed
The Warden: I am not one of you. Elturel proved what we knew all along - these horns and tail are a curse. || [context] NodeContext: determined and authorative - trying to make her fellow tieflings see the power of the absolute
The Warden: The Absolute gave me a new name, a new life. She can do the same for you. || [context] NodeContext: determined and authorative - trying to make her fellow tieflings see the power of the absolute

Lia: I'll get us out of here, Cal - even if I need to kill every bastard in this hellspit. || [context] NodeContext: fiercely determined
Cal: I know. And I'll be right alongside you if it comes to that. || [context] NodeContext: knows his sister would give her life for him, feels the same about her
Lia: We won't let them win. Not now, not ever. || [context] NodeContext: determined

----- Session: AD_WardenInspection -----
Wulbren Bongle: I'll die before I submit to you, or your pitiful god. || [context] NodeContext: full of confidence
The Warden: You're not dying, Wulbren - not for a long, long time. || [context] NodeContext: threatening a prisoner with a cold, cruel smile
The Warden: Extremeties, even organs, can all be removed - piece by piece, yet still you'll breathe. || [context] NodeContext: threatening a prisoner with a cold, cruel smile
Wulbren Bongle: I... bet you use that line a lot. || [context] NodeContext: flustered and scared as he tries to be brave during an interrogation
The Warden: I do. And every, single time, the prisoner cries out for the Absolute - right before they die. You will be no different, little Wulbren. || [context] NodeContext: threatening a prisoner with a cold, cruel smile

----- Session: AD_ToolAccepted -----
Wulbren Bongle: This is it. || [context] NodeContext: Assured - player has done has wulbren asked (because why would they do anything else?)

----- Session: AD_WaitingForGnomes -----
Lakrissa: Shh. Not a word - the gnomes are on their way. || [context] NodeContext: Quiet, hushed, determined (about to escape the prison)

----- Session: Guard_004 -----
Zealot Nadi: Don't speak to the prisoners. The Absolute forbids it.

----- Session: GnomePrisoner_002 -----
Nickels: Nimble said to close my eyes. But I can hear it - the stone is screaming. || [context] NodeContext: terrified

----- Session: Boat -----
Wulbren Bongle: There's no time! I'm leaving - hold them off. || [context] NodeContext: Yelling. Authorative and grave - he's about to flee while the player fights enemies off
Player: I will not fall in battle - we will meet again. || [approval] ['Astarion 1', "Lae'zel 1", 'Shadowheart 1', 'Karlach 1', 'Gale 1', 'Wyll 1']
Wulbren Bongle: You will kill many, I have no doubt. But should you fall... I hope it's quick. Thank you. || [context] NodeContext: authorative and grave - knows he's leaving the player to die

----- Session: Lover -----
Danis: Hey! You were in the grove, right? || [context] NodeContext: Panicked, frantic - speaking through prison bars
Player: I remember you - Danis, right?
Danis: Yes! I was with Bex in the grove. We talked getting a house in Baldur's Gate. Have you seen her? || [context] NodeContext: bex is the love of your life - terrified she's hurt or worse

----- Session: Wulbren -----
Wulbren Bongle: What in the Nine Hells have you done? Moonrise has lost its damn mind - and we're next on the cutting block. || [context] NodeContext: furious with player
Player: In my defence, it was an accident.
Wulbren Bongle: Gaerdal help me. || [context] NodeContext: Furious. "Gaerdal" = GAIR-dul. Gaerdal is a deity, so expressed like "God help me."
Wulbren Bongle: We need to get out of here or we're stone dead. Get us tools, anything that could crack the wall behind us. || [context] NodeContext: panicked - desperately trying to sway player
Wulbren Bongle: Or find a way to get this damn door open. Hurry! || [context] NodeContext: panicked - desperately trying to sway player
Player: Got it - I'll be back soon. || [approval] ['Gale 1', "Lae'zel 1", 'Astarion 1', 'Shadowheart 1', 'Wyll 1', 'Karlach 1', 'Halsin 1', 'Minthara 1']
Wulbren Bongle: Hurry - or we're all dead. || [context] NodeContext: trying not to sound to frustrated that the job isn't done - wants player to hurry

----- Session: Warden -----
The Warden: I am dead. || [context] NodeContext: clearly in some shock
The Warden: The prisoners have escaped - and the blame falls on me. I will be split open, my innards splayed before the eyes of the Absolute. || [context] NodeContext: deadpan, almost indifferent
The Warden: As it should be. || [context] NodeContext: closes eyes briefly and sighs as she accepts her fate
Player: I'm glad I snuck the prisoners out when I did. || [approval] ['Gale -1', 'Astarion 1', 'Shadowheart -1', 'Wyll 1', "Lae'zel -1", 'Karlach 1', 'Minthara -1', 'Halsin 1']
The Warden: Ha... hahaha. || [context] NodeContext: an almost hysterical laugh as the player confesses to helping prisoners escape
The Warden: The Absolute shines upon me. She tests me - then She gifts me you. I will now rip you apart - in Her name. || [context] NodeContext: zealous, relieved - about to attack player

----- Session: AD_ProdigyBrother -----
Cal: I can't stand this place. What's the hold up? || [context] NodeContext: quiet and tense  - waiting by the boat and safe for now, but that could change at a moment's notice

----- Session: AD_Gnome01 -----
Nimble: Damn it all - let's go! || [context] NodeContext: leaving the player behind to die as she hops on the boat and leaves

----- Session: AD_WardenInCombat -----
The Warden: Run. Beg. It matters not - this ends now. || [context] NodeContext: in a fight - absolutely furious with her opponents.

----- Session: AD_WardenSpottedMissingPrisoners -----
The Warden: What? Where are the prisoners? || [context] NodeContext: frantic, looking through the bars, panicked
The Warden: I'll be flayed alive for this. || [context] NodeContext: the usually intimidating warden is terrified for herself - knows her fate for letting the prisoners escpae

----- Session: Guard_002 -----

----- Session: AD_Wulbren -----
Wulbren Bongle: Blasted chains - keep the bastards off me! || [context] NodeContext: gritted teeth, trying to break the chains that have tied up the boat. Trying not to panic

----- Session: GnomePrisoner_001 -----
Nimble: Wulbren is the one you want, not I. || [context] NodeContext: dedicated and servile

----- Session: AD_GoToTieflings -----
Wulbren Bongle: Break the wall and go - if the tieflings can't keep up, it's their problem. || [context] NodeContext: running through the prison, brisk tone, he's annoyed he has to free the tieflings
