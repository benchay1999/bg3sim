Baldur's Gate 3 Dialog Paths
Total paths: 702

Synopsis: Wulbren is the leader of the Ironhand Gnomes. He is currently imprisoned in moonrise towers. He has the lazy charm of arrogant and the determination and cunning of the leader of a revolution. In this dialogue he offers you the main quest - to free him and the tieflings from the prison. He can speak to you through the bars - either with the player in prison, OR with the player speaking to them from the outside. NOTE: Wulbren pushes hard to charm the player and make them think they're friends. He keeps the friendly and charming mask on tight (dropping it only when he insults the player). We can have the lightest touch of menace in this dialogue, a hint that he's holding something back or that there is more to this than it seems, but it should be a light touch. He is friendly and charming here (the mask will drop back at Haven when he is rescued).
How to trigger: the gnomes are always in the prison in moonrise towers
