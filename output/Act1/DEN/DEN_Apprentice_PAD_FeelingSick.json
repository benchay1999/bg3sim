The player is slowly dying.The first stage is right after being stung by Nettie in the situation Halsin's Apprentice (the reaction of the player is covered in the dialog DEN_Apprentice_Cyanide).This PAD plays after a long rest: the player rested but the status is worsening. The status is getting to stage 2 and then to stage 3, each time having worse gameplay effects.After stage 3, the status kills the player; the PAD DEN_Apprentice_PAD_Dying plays in that case.|"
