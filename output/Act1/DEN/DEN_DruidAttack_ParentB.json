In her post attack dialogues, if her daughter has died her anger is waning even as she strives to hold onto it - the grief settling in as she realises all the dead druids in the world won't bring her daughter back.If her daughter in the post attack she is full of righteous anger - let anyone in the world take on the tieflings. They won't back down from anything.",
