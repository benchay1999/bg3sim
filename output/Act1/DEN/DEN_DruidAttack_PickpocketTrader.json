    "synopsis": "This dialogue plays either while the druids are attacking the tieflings in the grove, or after the druids have been defeated. During the attack, Lim is hidden away with the other tiefling children. She's fairly calm, given the situation - she's used to getting out of binds. Afterward, she's already plotting how she might get out ahead, though she's a bit irked at the player for getting rid of a source of income."
