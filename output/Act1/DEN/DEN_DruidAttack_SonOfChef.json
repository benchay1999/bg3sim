    "synopsis": "This dialogue plays either while the druids are attacking the tieflings in the grove, or after the druids have been defeated. During the attack, Ikaron is entirely focused on saving his people from the druids. Afterward, he's introspective, hurt that he and his people have had another safe harbour turn against him. Still, he is glad the players were there to help win the day."
