    "synopsis": "This dialogue plays during and after a group of druids turn on the tieflings in the grove and attack them. Gan is taken into a secret cave to hide during the druid attack. She's full of bravado - she's had training with a wooden sword, and she's eager to show off. She doesn't quite grasp the seriousness of the situation."
