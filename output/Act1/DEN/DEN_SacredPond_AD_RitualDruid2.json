    "synopsis": "This AD has two phases: the first plays if a druid ritual Kerrick was part of was stopped because their leader was exposed as a shadow druid. In this state, Kerrick feels angry and betrayed - he thought he was part of something good when really he was being used.The second state plays once the goblins that threatened the grove - and necessitated the ritual - have been dealt with. In this state, Kerrick is reflective and calm. The threat is gone, but there's much to be learned from it."
