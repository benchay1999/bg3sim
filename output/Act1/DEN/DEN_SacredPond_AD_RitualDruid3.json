    "synopsis": "This AD has two phases: the first plays if a druid ritual Inwe was part of was stopped because their leader was exposed as a shadow druid. In this state, Inwe is feeling sorry for herself. She's overcome with shame for being a part of a shadow druid plot.The second state plays once the goblins that threatened the grove - and necessitated the ritual - have been dealt with. In this state, Inwe isn't quite convinced the danger is over. She's jumping at shadows, imagining danger where there's presumably none."
