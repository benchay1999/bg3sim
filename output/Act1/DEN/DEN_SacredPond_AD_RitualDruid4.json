    "synopsis": "This AD has two phases: the first plays if a druid ritual Elwyn was part of was stopped because their leader was exposed as a shadow druid. In this state, Elwyn is preoccupied with the goblins - she's afraid that without the protection the ritual would have provided, they don't have a chance against them.The second state plays once the goblins that threatened the grove - and necessitated the ritual - have been dealt with. In this state, Elwyn is calm, the weight of the goblin threat finally off her shoulders."
