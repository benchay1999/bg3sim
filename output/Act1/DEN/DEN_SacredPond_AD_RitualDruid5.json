    "synopsis": "This AD has two phases: the first plays if a druid ritual Tahani was part of was stopped because their leader was exposed as a shadow druid.The second state plays once the goblins that threatened the grove - and necessitated the ritual - have been dealt with. In both states, Tahani is bitter, muttering her xenophobic ideas to herself. She thinks the tieflings (and the player) are the cause of all their troubles and that they should've been thrown out a long time ago."
