    "synopsis": "This dialogue can occur in three different states: In the first, Elwyn is in a trance, chanting a spell that will cover the druid grove in thorns. In the second, the ritual has been stopped after a druid named Kagha was exposed as a Shadow Druid. Elwyn is conflicted - she knows why the ritual had to be stopped, but she's scared that they've been left defenceless.In the third, a group of goblins that had threatened the grove has been dealt with and the grove is considered safe again. In this state, Elwyn is calm but exhausted, the weight of the goblin threat finally off her shoulders.The player always encounters Elwyn around a sacred druid pool."
