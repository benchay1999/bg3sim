    "synopsis": "This dialogue can occur in three different states: In the first, Tahani is in a trance, chanting a spell that will cover the druid grove in thorns. In the second, the ritual has been stopped after a druid named Kagha was exposed as a Shadow Druid. Tahani is furious that players stopped the ritual - even though Kagha had ulterior motives, Tahani still believes her path was best and that players had no right to intervene.In the third, a group of goblins that had threatened the grove has been dealt with and the grove is considered safe again. In this state, Tahani isn't convinced the threat is really over. She thinks her fellow druids will lead them down the same path again, taking pity on people that will only bring trouble to their door.The player always encounters Inwe around a sacred druid pool. She's more or less the xenophobic conservative of the chanting druids."
