    "synopsis": "Companion reaction to the player destroying the DangerousBook ('The Necromancy of Thay'). This book was clearly magical, whispering offers of dark power. You destroyed it by dropping it on the ground and blasting it with radiant damage. When you destroyed it, there were some spooky vfx. Most characters would see this as a good thing. Gale, Astarion wanted the book for themselves, however."
