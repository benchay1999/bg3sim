    "synopsis": "The player is exploring a ruined house that once belonged to a rural doctor. As they look around, they realise that the home's resident was in fact a wizard, laying low and conducting his own secret experiments while maintaining his cover as a doctor. Here, the player notices something odd about a mirror, but they can't quite figure out what (they're in fact detecting the energy of a magical trap that resides within the mirror)."
