    "synopsis": "This VB plays after saving Ethel from the two brothers of the sister she's holding captive. Ether disappeared in a magic puff, and she was acting suspicious. The players are reacting to her exit and discussing that there may be more to Ethel than meets the eye.Speaker 1 may have been the character who was in dialog for the scene with Ethel. Speaker 2 is another party member. However, since there may be combat, this setup isn't guaranteed and it's best to write this assuming everyone had a hand in the actions that led to this VB playing."
