    "synopsis": "This victim was cursed to see the future by the hag. In his initial dialogue, he is SEVERELY traumatised - sitting down, knees up, peeking out between his arms. He should sound quite disturbed, as if his sanity has long since deserted him.\n\nHe doesn't look at the player until halfway through the dialogue. When he looks up, he believes the player to be a monster of nightmares - a mindflayer. This is a terrifying moment for the player, as they are fighting a parasite in their head that will cause them to turn into a mindflayer.\n\nIn his dialogue in which he's met the player but has survived the hag, his gift is gone - but once he realises the player is the monster he saw before, he runs - terrified. \n\nIn his post hag dialogue he is saddened and clearly traumatised by his time with the hag - and the thought of the life he could have led."
