The most likely interruption is triggering a combat (player attacks any npc there including Voss or the dragon, or drags another hostile npc near them)This interruption happens in gameplay, so normally the Rider (Kith'rak Voss) and the Dragon would also leave in gameplay, but animations don't have the tech support to make the Rider ride the dragon like this, so we play this cutscene instead"
