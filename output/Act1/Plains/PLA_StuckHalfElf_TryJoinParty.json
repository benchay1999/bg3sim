    "synopsis": "Benryn finds himself faced with multiple crises in this dialogue. When the player finds him, he is frantic and coughing, trapped beneath a collapsed beam within a burning building. If the player rescues him, he frantically and desperately searches for his wife, who was outside when a band of goblins and drow attacked the inn they were staying at. Finally, if the player finds his wife's body, he is heartbroken - he believes her death is his fault, because of a silly argument that they had.\n\nWhen players first encounter Benryn, he is trapped beneath a heavy beam in a burning building. If the player helps him escape, Benryn joins the party until they exit the building safely. Once outside, Benryn is in shock at the carnage around him - bodies of goblins and humans litter the inn's courtyard. He snaps out of his shock when he thinks of his wife, who was outside when the raiding party arrived. He pleads for the player to help him find her - when players do, she is already dead. Pointed to her body, Benryn breaks down - the weight of guilt immediately crushing him."
