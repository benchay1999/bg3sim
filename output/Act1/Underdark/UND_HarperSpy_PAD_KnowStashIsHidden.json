    "synopsis": "Note: this PAD follows directly from either RecogniseStashLocation or FoundRune. See Kevin V. with any questions, I know it is a bit weird.--------When the player recognises that the Harper rune in Ketheric City is marking a hidden stash, they make an Investigation check. On success, they realise that the Harpers would be smart enough not to leave their stash in plain sight - the goal of this hint is to deter the player from interacting with the mimics in the area and to instead look around for a hidden stash somewhere",
