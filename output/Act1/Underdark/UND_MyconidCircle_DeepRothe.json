    "synopsis": "A Deep Rothe that belongs to Derryth and Baelen Bonecloak. A beast of burden with a simple Speak with Animals dialogue. There's some reactivity depending on whether Baelen has returned to the bonecloak camp or not, and if Baelen recovered his senses by eating the noblestalk mushroom. The animal's observations reinforce that Baelen has been more amiable and gentle since his mind began to slip, and his recovery is not seen as a good thing by all."
