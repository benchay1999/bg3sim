    "synopsis": "In Arcane Tower there's a button on the floor near an empty bucket. Pressing the button while wearing Cleric pet's collar drops food (currently blue cheese). Kind of auto-feeding device.This PAD happens on button press. There're variants: player who pressed button wears the collar, and so it just works. Player has it in pocket, then the collar vibrates a little. Another party character nearby has the collar, then that character comments about vibrating."
