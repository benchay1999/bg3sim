    "synopsis": "The player is affected by the strange fumes in the hatchery surrounding the egg (actually gith pheromones). To non-gith, they stink and weaken you slightly (gain status to make you more vulnerable to physical damage). To gith characters, they're actually quite pleasant and make you feel tougher (status gives you resistence to physical damage boost).",
    "how_to_trigger": "When the player first steps into the hatchery, which is filed with gith pheromone fumes.Use Debug Book to travel to Act 1b -> Creche - Main Creche floorGet through the dialog with the guards at the checkpoint (you'll likely need to use killcombat in recon)Once through the doors go left (west), then right (north), and enter the Hatchery Chamber through the door at the end of the corridor."
