    "how_to_trigger": "- Load up GustavDev/SCL_Main_A- Use ReCon command \"oe MemLib_AllJars\" to get all the brain jars and teleport to the Brain Reading Device.- In front of you will be a severed head and a receptacle to its left. Insert the appropriate brain jar into the receptacle by interacting with it - the jar is called \"Slave Mind\".- After inserting the jar, it will appear on top of the receptacle and you can talk to the severed head for the dialogue to start.- This jar is one of the two jars that can be found in the tutorial level (Nautiloid)."
