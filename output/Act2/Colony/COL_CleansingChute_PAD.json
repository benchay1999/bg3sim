    "how_to_trigger": "In the lower floor of the Mind Flayer Colony, find your way to the Cleansing Room. In here, there is a large chute leading in from the (inaccessible) Oubliette on the other side. Approach the chute and press the illithid console button next to it, and a corpse will come rolling out. A short moment afterwards, this PAD will play as a reaction to this. The corpse will only roll out once, and this PAD will also only play once."
