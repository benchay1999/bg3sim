    "synopsis": "A player reacts to getting splattered in blood and guts when they are standing below the corpse chute of the Colony Cleansing Room, when it is opened up. On the first time, a corpse will come falling out, but afterwards the chute simply serves as a blood shower at the press of the button.",
    "how_to_trigger": "In the lower floor of the Mind Flayer Colony, find your way to the Cleansing Room. In here, there is a large chute leading in from the (inaccessible) Oubliette on the other side. Place one player character beneath the corpse chute/tentacle, and let another press the button to open the chute. Blood will spurt out and the player getting sprayed will react to this."
