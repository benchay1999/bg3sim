    "synopsis": "Quick-fire Elder Brain ADs in the Colony corridors. If the party attacked Ketheric on the Moonrise Rooftop, there will be more frantic, fast-paced ADs from the Elder Brain surrounding us in quick succession, similar to when we approach the Elder Brain in the Morphic Pool. In this flow, the evacuation of the Colony is a lot more pressing because Ketheric was attacked.",
    "how_to_trigger": "- Load up GustavDev/SCL_Main_A- Use command \"oe COL_TeleportPlayer 0\" or use the debugbook to go to the Main Entrance of the Colony- Use \"oe EBAD_RapidMindmeld\" to trigger these ADs."
