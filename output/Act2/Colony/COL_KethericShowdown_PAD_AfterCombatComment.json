    "synopsis": "A PAD commenting on defeating Ketheric in his Apostle form at the end of the mind flayer Colony. After this the player will say that they need to go discuss the next course of action with their allies (alluding to Intermezzo in Moonrise Tower).At this point the players should take Ketheric's Netherstone (but we can't ensure that a player hasn't already looted said netherstone off his corpse by the time that end node is played).If there are two players available, they will banter together, otherwise a solo PAD will play.",
    "how_to_trigger": "- Load up GustavDev/SCL_Main_A- Use \"oe KethericShowdown_Defeat\"- Go through the interactive dialogue. A PAD should play afterwards."
