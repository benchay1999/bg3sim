    "synopsis": "The players react to gaining or losing the \"Eldritch Pleasure\" status effect from the Resonance Stone in the secret sideroom of the Colony kitchen/dissection room. This status is applied or removed upon gaining the \"Eldritch Pleasure\" buff bestowed by the aura effect of the Resonance Stone, and will only play once per user and nearby player. The removal dialog will only trigger upon losing the buff while inside a trigger near the Colony kitchen, as to avoid it playing unexpectedly during later parts of the game.",
    "how_to_trigger": "This dialog is triggered once per user and nearby players upon gaining or losing the Eldritch Pleasure buff (determined by a flag) as bestowed by the aura of the Resonance Stone in the secret sideroom of the kitchen/dissection room on the lower floor of the Colony. The Resonance Stone can be picked up and may give the Eldritch Pleasure buff to those nearby the player carrying the stone. The removal dialog will only trigger upon losing the buff while inside a trigger near the Colony kitchen."
