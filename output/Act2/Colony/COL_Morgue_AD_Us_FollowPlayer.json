    "synopsis": "This AD plays upon freeing Us from its cage in the Colony Morgue, without triggering a crime reaction from Chop, the Colony Butcher. In that case, Us will start following the first player they see (or the player that got them out) and request to get out of the Morgue and to safety.",
    "how_to_trigger": "- Load up GustavDev/SCL_Main_A- Use ReCon command \"oe morgue_us\" and \"oe COL_Butcher\", in either order- Walk over to the cage that Us is in- Use command \"oe morgue_cagesneak\": Chop will be blinded and Us' cage will be unlocked- Us will start looking for a player to follow: when they follow you, this AD will play."
