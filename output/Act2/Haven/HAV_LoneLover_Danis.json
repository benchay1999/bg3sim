    "synopsis": "Danis' dialog in Haven after his rescue.He has made it safely to Haven after escaping Moonrise Towers and has been reunited with Bex, his partner, if she's alive, or is alone if she's not. If she's alive, the player witnessed a really cute reunion between them, and these dialogues cover Danis' followups to that conversation, as well as versions for if he's alone and for a few states in Haven. Not all states are covered since Danis doesn't care much about Ketheric"
