    "synopsis": "Fallback AD for the flaming fist spy. If he didn't vouch for the player in Entering Haven, he sticks around after the scene, this is to give the chance to the player to notice him. As soon as the player approaches him though, he starts walking away. The player shouldn't normally be able to click on him before he starts moving, but I can't garantee that some frame delay might happen... So this is a vary short AD, a feedback in case the player manages to click on him. He'll say it while turning around and moving away. The player can later talk to him in the dialog HAV_TakingIsobel_FlamingSpy."
