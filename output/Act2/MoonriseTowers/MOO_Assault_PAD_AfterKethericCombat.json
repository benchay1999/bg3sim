    "how_to_trigger": "- Load up GustavDev/SCL_Main_A- Use the debugbook -> MOO quest flags and options -> either start the Assault on Moonrise/Audience with the Absolute and attack Ketheric on the rooftop of Moonrise Tower- Get Ketheric to leave to the Colony (killcombat or Ctrl+Shift+K Ketheric, keep attacking Ketheric if he's still invulnerable)- After the combat is over, a player will say this PAD after a few seconds, while still on the rooftop and not blocked from talking"
