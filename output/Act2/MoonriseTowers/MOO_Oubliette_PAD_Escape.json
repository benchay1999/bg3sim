    "how_to_trigger": "In order for this dialog to trigger, the player character must first enter the bloodbath section of the Oubliette (everything below the cave overhang) and then return up to the prison by entering S_MOO_Oubliette_Escape_Box. A quick way to trigger this dialog is by using the debug commands \"oe Oubliette_Enter\" and \"oe Oubliette_Entrance_Escape\" in order."
