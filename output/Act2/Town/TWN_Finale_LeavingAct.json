    "synopsis": "Scene of players leaving SCL to travel to Intermezzo. This scene triggers when the party leave Moonrise Tower after defeating Ketheric. There are two variants. One where the curse has been lifted, one where the curse hasn't been lifted.If the curse has been lifted, Halsin and/or Art Cullagh will be present at Moonrise if alive, and will tell players that the quest has succeeded, and that when they leave Moonrise, they'll see the restults. They tell you to wrap up your business here first. This happens in the dialogues for those characters, not here.If the curse hasn't been lifted, players see a vista of the shadow-cursed lands on leaving Moonrise, and move on toward the Risen Road.",
