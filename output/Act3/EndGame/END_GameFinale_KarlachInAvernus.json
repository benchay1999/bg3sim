    "synopsis": "In this post-credits sequence, Karlach and the player arrive in Avernus. She's still stuck in the middle of the Blood War, but she is, at least, alive. She quickly realizes her engine is 'fixed' as long as she stays down here and rapidly goes through the stages of grief to accpeting that she's back where she swore she'd never go - but at least she's in her element. Kicking ass, fucking shit up - and this  time, she has someone she loves with her. Maybe this could work after all... at least for now.Tone here is optimistic, though ambiguous. Is this a good ending? A bad ending? Something in the middle? No matter what, we want to show Karlach at the height of her coolness. This is not our goofy dork; this is a powerhouse who knows how to survive, no matter what, and may even have fun this time around. Clint Karlach Eastwood mixed with 80s action star. Bring it on, baby."
