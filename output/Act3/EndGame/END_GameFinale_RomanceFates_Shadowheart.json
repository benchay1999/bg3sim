    "synopsis": "Shadowheart and her love interest player talk in a private bedroom in an inn, the morning after spending the night together after saving the world. A discussion of what comes next ensues, varying depending on how Shadowheart's story unfolded. She could:- have remained committed to Shar and have sacrificed her parents. She is now in charge of Shar's church.- she could have abandoned Shar at the last moment and saved her parents- she could have turned from Shar in Act 2, and set out on a mission to save her parents in Act 3, rescuing them- she could have turned from Shar in Act 2, and set out on a mission to save her parents in Act 3, but instead euthanized them to free them from Shar's curse.- none of the above are applicable, and she is aware she has unfinished (and undefined) business she needs to tend to."
