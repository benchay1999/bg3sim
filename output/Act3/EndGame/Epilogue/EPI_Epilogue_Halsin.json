    "synopsis": "Halsin at party organised by Withers at the very end of the game.The past few months, he's been building a community for people who were dispossessed by the upheaval the Absolute created. He's the elder/unofficial leader of this community, which has been founded on the lands that were reclaimed from the Shadow Curse in Act 2. He's at peace now, having found a sense of balance between nature and civilisation that had previously escaped him. He's more comfortable leading this new group than he was as Archdruid, and is looking forward to seeing it prosper. He's also acting as guardian for a number of orphans created by the wars of late.States:The player did not join him at his new community. Halsin catches them up on what he's been doing this past while, and enquires what they've been up to in turn. He's particularly keen to mine some good stories from the player of their recent exploits, that he can entertain his young charges with when he returns to them. This flow could be purely platonic, or have some parts that acknowledge they were old flames.The player did join him at his new community. They arrive at the party together. Halsin shows a little anxiety that the player may regret having opted to live a relatively quiet existence with him, but soon settles in the enjoy the party. This flow is for those who were in a romance with him."
