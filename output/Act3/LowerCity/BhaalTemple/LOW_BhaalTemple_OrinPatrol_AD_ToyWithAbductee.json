    "synopsis": "In Bhaal Temple, Orin does a short 'patrol' around the altar where the abductee is tied up. She starts from the altar, 'inspects/toys' with the bound abductee, then walks over to her minions and talks with them briefly. She continues this patrol indefinitely with some randomness to her timing, allowing the players to try to plan/time the rescue stealthily.This is the AD that plays when she is 'toying' with the abductee."
