    "synopsis": "Lady Quinsy is a member of the Ladies Court, Nine-Fingers' elite personal bodyguard. They're each as deadly as disease, and named for such.They don't waste much time talking - in these lines, they're simply stating the way they'd kill us if they had to and, later, the name they'd give us if we joined them. In one final edge-case they repeat the same mantra as a threat if Nine-Fingers is dead and we're taking over.We only learn any of this when Lady Ague herself explains the strangeness.",
