    "synopsis": "Jaheira's youngest son, a timid and frightened little boy who's brave on the inside but his cousins tease him because he gets scared easily, so they think he's a coward and never let him show his value. He has two purposes - The first is to give the player a clue or two towards opening Jaheira's secret room (It involves the lever just outside the room, on the wall on the roof, and using a harper pin downstairs as a key in a bookcase to open her basement)The second, and it might be a little on the nose, but his cowardly-but-brave behaviour is all a setup for Jaheira to have a sweet little moment where she can have a nice little cathartic nod to Khalid and encourage the kid, because she believes in him. I'll expand on thisAlso I've made the rolls intended to be easy since a Harper Pin has very little use and it feels a little weird to restrict players too much from just finding out where it is, but I'm well aware that him being told to look after it then immediately giving it away to a stranger feels weird so there's probably a more sensible way for him to point to it without outright betraying his task!",
