    "how_to_trigger": "- Load up GustavDev/CTY_Main_A- Use \"oe MT_Start\", enter the tombstone shop and go down into the Murder Tribunal- Use \"oe MT_Dolor_Assault_Cheats\" to get Dolor to appear at the Death Knight guarding the courtroom. He will start attacking the Death Knight and will then turn his attention to the Murder Tribunal.- It's best to join this combat and use \"killcombat\", provided Dolor is still neutral to us.- If Dolor somehow survives the whole ordeal and the Tribunal ends up dead, he will turn on the players and say this AD on his first combat turn."
