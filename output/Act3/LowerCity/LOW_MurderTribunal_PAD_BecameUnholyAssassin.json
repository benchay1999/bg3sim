    "synopsis": "The party reacts to becoming an Unholy Assassin in the Bhaalist Murder Tribunal. This means Valeria was killed by either us or some other party member - if she was killed before we reached the Tribunal, her corpse will be here and we still bathe in her blood. Different companions will have different reactions to what they just did in order to become an Unholy Assassin.",
    "how_to_trigger": "- Load up GustavDev/CTY_Main_A- Use the debugbook options for the Murder Tribunal (act 3/LOW) to start the trial and go to the abattoir (Valeria can either be already dead or alive, it doesn't matter)- Alternatively, use ReCon command \"oe MT_Baptism\" and \"oe MT_Court\"- Kill Valeria if she's alive, otherwise step into the font of blood if she's already dead- You will become an Unholy Assassin - a few seconds after the wrap-up dialogue, this PAD will play."
