    "synopsis": "One liner reacting after Mystic Carrion, a mummy lord, has been killed. If Carrion's heart is not destroyed and therefore not fully dead, this means that players recognized Carrion as a mummy lord, and therefore know that he'll resurrect the next day if his heart is not destroyed.It's possible that players fail the intelligence check the first time, which will make them think he is dead when he is really not.On the other side, if the heart is destroyed, this one liner will serve as a confirmation that Carrion is fully dead.",
