    "synopsis": "A player remarks on a combat encounter with a Sahuagin that appeared on a beach in the Lower City. When the player approaches the shore, they come out of the sea and start attacking.Their presence alludes to the Iron Throne situation, as made clear through loot on their corpses. Sahuagin are scary-looking antropomorphic amphibians, sometimes called \"sea devils\" or \"fish heads\" (derogatory).Sahuagin is pronounced sah-HWAH-gin.",
    "how_to_trigger": "- Load up GustavDev/CTY_Main_A- Use ReCon command \"goto 52 3 -138\"- \"killcombat\" to kill all the Sahuagin after they appear and attack.- This PAD will play after a short delay, on a player who was in that combat."
