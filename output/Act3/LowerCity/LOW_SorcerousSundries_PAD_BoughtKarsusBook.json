    "synopsis": "PAD for when players acquire the Netherese book from Tolna, either from buying it or stealing it. It will trigger if Gale didnt express the interest in the book in the Tolna dialog (meaning he was far enough to not be in the inclusion). Players will note that would be interesting to show it to him. Alternatively, if the book was gotten by Gale himself as avatar, the hint will point towards reading it to trigger the AOM.",
    "how_to_trigger": "1) Go to CTY_Main_A 8; 26; -93 with only one avatar (in order no to trigger a dialog between an avatar and gale companion when leaving dialog)2) Buy The Annals of Karsus: A Netherese Folly from her3) Leave the dialog, which will trigger the PAD"
