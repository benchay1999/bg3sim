In particular most of these are just there to confirm when he's done/tried to do an action, but the \"Stolen ring\" one is also there to prompt players that he's going to turn hostile if they approach the door and get caught now - as it wouldn't be obvious otherwise.",
    "how_to_trigger": "In order:- Steal Tusgront's Ring (without being spotted) after the conversation, but before he's in position to open the door (Short time window, might need turn based mode)- Discover the secret door via perception, then cast knock/lockpick it- Convince Tusgront to open the door for you, then just actually let him do it."
