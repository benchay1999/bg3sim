    "synopsis": "Orin may impersonate several people in Wyrm's Crossing. The possible impersonations are :-- The Smith in Rivington- Lens the Journalist near Southcheck Point.- LoveDryad in the circus- Rowan the Flaming Fist at the big barn.- DyingAttacker at the Smuggler's Cave.Instead of these NPCs, Orin may take their place and impersonate them. This PAD dialog is meant to be played after she reveals herselfs and teleports away. First one should recognise Orin by name (to help the player), and acknowledge her shapeshifting ability. Second can be more flexible, wondering why she's doing it.",
