If the possessed zombie goes below half health, the monk will hop to another zombie and heal it. This AD will be played on the zombie that the monk will now start possessing.",
    "how_to_trigger": "- Load up GustavDev/BGO_Main_A- Use ReCon command \"oe SAM_Combat\"- Locate the zombie with the \"Possessed\" status (initially it will be Sister Shirra). Get them down below half health without killing them.- On the possessed zombie's turn, the monk's ghost will leave that zombie, and enter the new zombie's body. This AD will then play on the newly possessed zombie."
