If the possessed zombie goes below half health, the monk will hop to another zombie and heal it. This AD will play on the possessed zombie if there are no other zombies available to possess.",
    "how_to_trigger": "- Load up GustavDev/BGO_Main_A- Use ReCon command \"oe SAM_Combat\"- Locate the zombie with the \"Possessed\" status (initially it will be Sister Shirra). Get them down below half health without killing them.- Before you end your turn, kill all the non-possessed zombies.- On the possessed zombie's turn, the monk's ghost will be unable to leave this zombie's body and play this AD."
