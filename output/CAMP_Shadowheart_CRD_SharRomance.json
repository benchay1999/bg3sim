    "synopsis": "Shadowheart and the player wrestle with the nature of their romance, when it has already been stated that Shadowheart must dedicate herself to Shar, leaving no room for others in her life. She helps the player to interpret this in a manner that may let them bend the rules. Heavy on the flirtation and innuendo, as if to defect from less-romantic implications of their relationship status.Chronologically, this will occur after SH has committed to Shar by sacrificing Nightsong, but before the shar path sex scene that centres around a Nightfall ceremony.",
