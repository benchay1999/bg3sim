    "synopsis": "PAD that plays after the player read Arabella's letter in Act 3 Camp, telling them she has gone off to find her own way. Players will get different lines depending on if they resolved her Act 2 quest line fully by having her have a heart to heart with Jergal after losing her parents or not.Bad version text: [The ink is still fresh, and the letter is drawn in a careful hand.]So I guess I shouldn't be too mad. I mean, I'm not snake food thanks to you. But I still thought you'd be helping me out, finding my parents and stuff...Don't matter though really, does it?  The curse took them,  or maybe one of those cultist creeps. I got to accept that. Just like I got to accept I'm on my own now. But don't you go worrying, Bone Man said the weave'll guide me. Don't know what that means, exactly, but I'll figure it out.- ArabellaGood version text:[The ink is still fresh, and the letter is drawn in a careful hand.]Hey you. So, I owe you a lot. For one, I don't know what the inside of a snake's belly looks like. For another, you let me stay at your camp. And for ANOTHER another, you found out what happened to moms and pops.I'm on my own now and Bone Man says it's a good thing. I just have to let the Weave guide me. And as far as I can tell, it's tugging me to Baldur's Gate, so I'm headed there first.Anyway, thanks for everything. I won't forget it.- Arabella"
