He's a timid and frightened little boy who's brave on the inside but his cousins tease him because he gets scared easily, his cowardly-but-brave behaviour is all a setup for Jaheira to have a sweet little moment where she can have a nice little cathartic nod to Khalid and encourage the kid, because she believes in him, and leads to a moment where the player can contextualise this into her current dilemma - She was quick to determine that he was gone, but that was in her headstrong days when all was more...black and white. Now she has these doubts on whether she should be even considering having her life pace slowed by rite of simply being a strong druid or not.Same beats as the COM version, with a slight edit at the choice moment.",
