An NPC flees from a creature (actually wildshaped player).Fallback dialogue for GEB_AD_Herdmonster or GEB_AD_FleeFromMonster in case the monster comes nearby again within 30 seconds after it left the NPC's proximity. They will run away a little while saying this. It can rigger while they are still moving back to their original position after chasing it away. NPC can be adult or child of any species/race/gender. They can be alone or not. NOTE - Anyone with the DRUID or ACT1_DEN_IDOLTHEFT is exempt from this dialogue."
