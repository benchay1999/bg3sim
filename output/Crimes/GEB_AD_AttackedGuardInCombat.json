    "synopsis": "Most important message: if the player kills this NPC and there are witnesses that survive the combat, the player will be attacked by sight by guards in this region afterwards.Summary: The player attacked a guard during combat in a particular region (the Grove, Moonrise Towers, and eventually also the Goblin Camp, Haven, Wyrm's Crossing, Baldur's Gate proper). When doing so, the guard will play this AD to warn the player that killing them will result in them getting known as a \"guard killer\", and such players get attacked on sight by other guards in the same region.",
    "how_to_trigger": "Go the Grove in WLD_Main_A (206; 25; 555)\"roll horrible\" in recon. Attack Guex (near the training the tiefling kids). Then attack him again during combat. He will say this AD regularly when you attck him during the combat."
