This dialog is only played by \"cowardly\" NPCs: plain CIVILIANs and BEASTs that are not AGGREESIVEBEAST.Note: multiple NPCs will most likely play this dialog at the same time, or shortly after each other. So watch out with sequences, since those will be spread across multiple NPCs and not play in order on one NPC."
