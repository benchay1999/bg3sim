    "synopsis": "An NPC comments on a player shapeshifting/disguising/otherwise transforming while that player is wanted or being investigated for a crime. Normally, that player would be ignored for that crime from then on, but due to the NPC witnessing the transformation, they won't be. This dialog should make that clear. It will only trigger for non-GUARD NPCs (guards will arrest/interrogate them on sight).",
    "how_to_trigger": "Commit a crime in a region with a prison (e.g. the DEN)Get arrested and go to prisonTeleport out of prison in front of civilians (e.g. the packing tiefling couple)Shapeshift while they can see you."
