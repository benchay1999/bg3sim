    "synopsis": "Mimics use shapeshifting to pass as an ordinary object (like a chest or a door). This dialog is a generic AD after players succeed a perception check. They do not identify a mimic specifically, only a shapeshifted creature before interacting with it. As of 01.09.2021 was decided that the mimic-chest will stay a chest after being revealed. A vfx will be used and this AD. NOTE: mimic theoreticall can be any inanimate object, not only a chest.",
    "how_to_trigger": "Ask your local scripter to set up a mimic for you in a test level (it's not a very straightforward task atm). Or navigate to one of the mimics we have in Underdark in Act1. These are maintained by Andrew Tully. You have to succeed the perception check by walking near the mimic. Use console command `roll amazing` to ensure success."
