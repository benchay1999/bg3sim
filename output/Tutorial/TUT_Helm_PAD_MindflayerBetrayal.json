    "synopsis": "PAD oneliner for when all devils are killed in the helm combat, making the mindflayer switch sides and become hostile to players, saying that 'they are no longer required'. If this happened it means players focused on killing devils instead of interacting with the transponder like the mindflayer told them to.This line reacts to this event, giving a bit of explanation to players to the fact that the mindflayer is no longer an ally and that running to the transponder is their course of action.",
    "how_to_trigger": "1) Start TUT_Avernus_C and teleport to -13; 18; -3892)Interact with the helm door, after the dialog combat will start3)Kill all enemies, leaving players with ally mindflayer, who will then turn on players4) Line should play on next player turn"
