      "reasoning": "Two of the sessions \u2013 AD_Combat_Goblins_Caster_01 and AD_Combat_Goblins_Ranger_01 \u2013 are both combat ambush dialogues triggered when the player takes a turn in an encounter against goblins. They use different encounter identifiers (one for a caster enemy, one for a ranger enemy) but are otherwise functionally similar and do not depend on one another; they may even happen in the same combat encounter if both enemy types are present, so there is no fixed order between them. On the other hand, the session PatrollingGoblin_AD_JoinOgreFight is described as involving a goblin who \u201cjoins the fight\u201d when the player gets into combat with ogres. This indicates that its triggering condition (being involved in an ogre fight) is contextually different from that of the goblin ambush sessions. In a typical playthrough the ambush sessions (which are triggered when fighting goblins via their respective ambush identifiers) and the joining goblin session (which occurs when the player is engaged with ogres) would represent mutually exclusive branches of combat encounter. That is, if the player is in a goblin ambush encounter (triggering one or both of the ambush sessions), they would not be in the ogre fight where a patrolling goblin might join, and vice\u2010versa. Therefore, we consider that the PatrollingGoblin_AD_JoinOgreFight session is mutually exclusive with the two goblin ambush sessions. No definite ordering constraints between any of the provided sessions exist, aside from the fact that PatrollingGoblin_AD_JoinOgreFight logically follows the initiation of an ogre fight (which is not part of the provided data).",
