      "reasoning": "The session 'PAD_PlayerHeardEttercapWarning' involves the player encountering a spider web and receiving a warning from an ettercap. This event appears as an early clue about the presence of spiders. Later, during the descent cinematic, the player has two alternative outcomes: 'CINE_Descent_FF' where the player picks up and casts a Feather Fall scroll before jumping into a hole, and 'CINE_Descent_NoFF', which represents a descent without using Feather Fall. Because these cinematic descent sessions represent alternative ways to handle the same situation, they are mutually exclusive. Moreover, it makes sense that the warning about spiders ('PAD_PlayerHeardEttercapWarning') occurs before the descent sequences, serving as a narrative precursor that alerts the player to the dangers that follow.",
