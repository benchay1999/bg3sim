This implies they are mutually exclusive: if one occurs (the player casts Feather Fall), then the other cannot. In addition, the session 'PAD_PlayerHeardEttercapWarning' appears to be an early alert \u2013 the player touches a spider web and hears an ettercap warning \u2013 and it logically seems to occur before the descent events. Thus, regardless of whether the player later triggers the Feather Fall cinematic or not, the warning will precede both descent sequences.",
