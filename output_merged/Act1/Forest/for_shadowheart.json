The AD_FoundJournal session involves finding an old diary in the ruined schoolhouse, which likely provides background and context for events in the village. Later in act 12, the player can trigger PAD_SeluniteNecklace by looting the necklace in the blacksmith, suggesting that any insights gained from the journal may inform or set up the reflection on the necklace. Therefore, it makes sense that AD_FoundJournal should occur before PAD_SeluniteNecklace. The PAD_SeluniteRitualScroll session takes place in a separate location (the Owlbear cave) and does not show any obvious ordering dependency or conflict with the other sessions. Additionally, there is no evidence from the provided descriptions that any of these sessions are mutually exclusive.",
