In contrast, the 'AD_Crack' session is an SFX event in which the bridge creaks and collapses. From the narrative description, the two sessions represent alternative outcomes: if the party pays attention in 'AD', they can avoid disaster, while if they remain oblivious, then the 'AD_Crack' event occurs. Therefore, if 'AD_Crack' is to be triggered it implies a failure to heed the warning delivered in 'AD', meaning that the collapse can only occur as a consequence (or alternative branch) following the initial situation. As a result, there is both an ordering constraint (the potential collapse logically comes after the warning) and a mutual exclusiveness (the safe crossing indicated in 'AD' and the collapse in 'AD_Crack' cannot both occur in the same playthrough).",
