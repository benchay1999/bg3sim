The triggering condition specifies that the dialog occurs when a player character is alone under any of the statues. This implies that if one of these dialogs is triggered (i.e., the player destroys one statue), the opportunity to trigger any of the other statue dialogs in the same encounter is effectively lost. Therefore, these sessions are mutually exclusive. There is no narrative or triggering information suggesting that one of these sessions necessarily happens before another in a sequential order.",
