      "reasoning": "In the provided sessions, we can identify that 'Torturers_Spike_MurderCustom' is triggered by an action of killing, which implies that it is a direct consequence of a prior action. This suggests that there is a sequential relationship where the murder must happen before the dialogue with Spike can occur. Additionally, 'Torturers_Goblet_AssaultCustom' indicates a reaction to an attack or killing, which means it also has a dependency on a preceding action. Since both 'Torturers_Spike_MurderCustom' and 'Torturers_Goblet_AssaultCustom' relate to violent actions, they cannot occur simultaneously, as they both refer to the aftermath of different violent events involving the same character (Spike). Thus, they are mutually exclusive as they cannot both reflect different outcomes from the same scenario.",
