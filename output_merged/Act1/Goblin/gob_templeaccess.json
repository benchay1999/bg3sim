Since these actions are inherently sequential (you cannot climb down without first climbing up), CINE_ClimbUp must occur before CINE_ClimbDown. Therefore, CINE_ClimbUp is the predecessor to CINE_ClimbDown. There are no mutually exclusive sessions in this context, as both sessions represent different actions that can logically occur in sequence.",
