      "reasoning": "Both sessions are triggered in the same overall scenario when interacting with the Gur Hunter in the Swamp with Astarion at your camp. The first session, PAD_BetrayedAstarion, is played if the player reveals Astarion's whereabouts, effectively handing him over to the Gur Hunter. The second session, PAD_ProtectedAstarion, occurs when the player chooses to lie and deny any connection to Astarion, thereby not handing him over. Since these actions represent alternative choices (handing over versus protecting Astarion), they are mutually exclusive, meaning that in a single playthrough, only one of them can occur. There is no inherent cause\u2013consequence or sequential dependency between the two sessions; they are simply alternative outcomes based on the player's decision.",
