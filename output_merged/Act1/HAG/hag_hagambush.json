The players are reacting to her exit and discussing that there may be more to Ethel than meets the eye.Speaker 1 may have been the character who was in dialog for the scene with Ethel. Speaker 2 is another party member. However, since there may be combat, this setup isn't guaranteed and it's best to write this assuming everyone had a hand in the actions that led to this VB playing.",

This implies that there is an implicit precursor event (i.e., the 'saving Ethel' event) that must occur before 'PAD_SidedHag' can be triggered. Since there are no other sessions given or explicit naming for the 'saving Ethel' event, we denote this precursor with a placeholder (e.g., 'SaveEthel'). There are no clear mutual exclusiveness constraints mentioned in the provided data.",
