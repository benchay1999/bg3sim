One branch involves active intervention: the Flaming Fist force their way into the burning inn, begin clearing rubble (AD_Working), and then encounter the trapped counsellor (AD_FlamingFist1ComeIn), who calls out once they\u2019ve entered. This makes AD_Working a prerequisite for AD_FlamingFist1ComeIn. In another branch, if the player attempts to engage the Flaming Fist while they are busy, a different session (AD_Occupied) is triggered, representing them being unavailable for dialogue. Because these two branches represent mutually exclusive states (the group is either in the process of working/engaging with the trapped individual, or they are too busy to talk), AD_Occupied cannot co-occur with AD_Working or its consequence AD_FlamingFist1ComeIn. The generic dialogue session (with an empty key) seems to be an alternative version of the entry scene (either during the rubble-pushing phase or when searching/clearing rubble) and does not impose additional ordering constraints beyond what is already determined by the working/entering branch.",
