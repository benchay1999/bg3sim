      "reasoning": "The two sessions 'Victim_003_AD_HeartAttack' and 'Victim_003_PAD_HeartAttack' both deal with Lorin suffering a fatal heart attack after being forced from his corner in the hag's lair. Their synopses indicate two variations of the same event (one where Lorin begs for forgiveness from the hag, and another where he begs Ethel for mercy). Thus, they represent mutually exclusive outcomes for the same scenario. The other session 'Victim_001_AD_Dying' appears to be an alternate consequence (an edge-case) when the player does not speak to the victim, and 'Rudder' provides no information tying it to any order or alternative conditions. Consequently, no ordering constraints can be determined among these sessions, other than the noted mutually exclusive pair.",
