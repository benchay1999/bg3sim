      "reasoning": "Looking at the synopses, three sessions involve the victim (Lorin). Two of these sessions \u2013 'Victim_003_PAD_HeartAttack' and 'Victim_003_AD_HeartAttack' \u2013 both describe the event where the player forces Lorin out of the corner of the hag\u2019s lair and he then suffers a heart attack. The two versions appear to be alternative treatments of the same core event (one with a prescient Lorin and one where he obeyed the hag\u2019s order to stay while panicking). In addition, the session 'Victim_001_AD_Dying' is described as an edge case triggered when the player does not speak to the victim, leading to his death via de-petrification rather than a heart attack. This clearly means that the player\u2019s approach (speaking vs. not speaking) determines the outcome \u2013 only one of these victim\u2010related sessions can occur in a given playthrough. Therefore, these three sessions are mutually exclusive. Although the heart attack events imply an order (the player\u2019s action of forcing Lorin out must occur before his heart attack), that causal action is implicit within each session and is not represented by a separate session. The session 'Rudder' lacks contextual detail and apparent connections to the other sessions, so it remains independent.",
