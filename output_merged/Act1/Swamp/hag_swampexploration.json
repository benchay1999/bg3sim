The 'PAD_HeroGear' session involves discovering a hero's gear in a bog with an investigation check, while 'PAD_PrickedFinger' deals with a scenario of pricking one's finger on a thorny bush and is triggered by a Sleight of Hand test. Since there is no indication that one session leads to or prevents the other, there are no ordering constraints or mutual exclusiveness relationships between these sessions.",
