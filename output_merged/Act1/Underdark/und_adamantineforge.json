CINE_HammerStrike shows a party member activating a lever at the Adamantine Forge, which\u2014given the context\u2014appears as a follow\u2010up event that is enabled when the forge is operative. In narrative terms it makes sense for the party to first find the object in AD_FoundKey before triggering mechanisms in CINE_HammerStrike. There is no indication that these two sessions are mutually exclusive; rather, they appear to be sequential parts of the same storyline.",
