      "reasoning": "The how_to_trigger text for session '03' actually strings together several labeled dialogue triggers. Although the session key is '03', the instructions reference distinct dialogue 'labels' which seem to represent different parts of the encounter. We see a clear chain: first the player triggers 'Greeting -1', then the player can trigger 'Mutiny happened -1', and thereafter the instructions lead to triggering a conversation where either 'Nere killed -1' or an alternate dialogue 'Nere Killed hasmet' may occur. In other words, after the mutiny event, the player faces an encounter with Thudd that can yield one of two outcomes. Since these two outcomes represent different (and alternative) story paths, they are mutually exclusive. Also, the ordering implies that the Greeting must come before the mutiny and the mutiny must come before the encounter with Thudd that leads to either the 'Nere killed -1' outcome or the alternate 'Nere Killed hasmet' outcome.",
