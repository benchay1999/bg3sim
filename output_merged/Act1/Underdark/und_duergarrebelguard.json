      "reasoning": "Although the overall input only contains one session key ('03'), its internal 'how_to_trigger' string actually lists several named dialogue triggers. Reading the text, we can identify a chain of events: first the dialogue labeled 'Greeting -1' is initiated, then the event 'Mutiny happened - 1' is triggered (after talking to Kirgrat), followed by 'Nere killed - 1' (after, for example, destroying the wall, siding with rebels, and so on), and finally a variant labeled 'Nere Killed hasmet' is reached. This indicates a narrative flow where one event causes the next. There is no indication that any of these steps are mutually exclusive (i.e. one does not preclude another) but rather that the latter dialogue builds upon the consequences of the previous one. Thus, we derive an ordering where each named trigger must occur in sequence. (Note that although these named triggers are parts of the single session '03', they represent distinct narrative moments that must follow one another.)",
