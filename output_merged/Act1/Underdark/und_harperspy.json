One branch (PAD_RecogniseStashLocation) is reached when the party has read the Harper\u2019s letter and goes to where the stash is expected, while the other branch (PAD_FoundRune) occurs when the party instead notices a strange marking that might be recognised as a Harper symbol. The synopsis for PAD_KnowStashIsHidden explicitly states that it follows directly from either of these two sessions \u2013 meaning that, logically, one of them must occur before PAD_KnowStashIsHidden is triggered. This indicates an order constraint: PAD_KnowStashIsHidden should come after either PAD_RecogniseStashLocation or PAD_FoundRune. Since these two sessions represent alternative branches (one or the other is triggered based on the player\u2019s actions), they are mutually exclusive; if one branch happens, the other does not appear in that same playthrough. PAD_RecogniseWatchword does not interact with the order between the stash sessions as it is simply triggered by reading the diary, so no ordering or exclusivity constraints are defined for it here.",
