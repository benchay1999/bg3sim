      "reasoning": "After examining the session descriptions and their trigger conditions, two key relationships emerge. First, the session PAD_KnowStashIsHidden is described as following directly from either PAD_RecogniseStashLocation or PAD_FoundRune \u2013 meaning that the event confirming that the stash is hidden only occurs if one of these two sessions has already been triggered. This establishes ordering constraints: PAD_RecogniseStashLocation should come before PAD_KnowStashIsHidden, and PAD_FoundRune should come before PAD_KnowStashIsHidden. Second, both PAD_RecogniseStashLocation and PAD_FoundRune are triggered based on visiting the same area (their coordinate targets are identical) and represent alternative ways for the party to learn about the stash (one by reading a Harper letter and the other by discovering a mysterious marking). Because only one of these approaches is expected to occur in a given playthrough, these two sessions are mutually exclusive. The PAD_RecogniseWatchword session, although triggered by reading the same diary that underlies PAD_RecogniseStashLocation, serves a different narrative purpose (recognizing a watchword) and does not impose additional ordering constraints with respect to the stash-location-related sessions (other than the common requirement of having read the diary), so it is not included in the ordering or exclusiveness rules here.",
