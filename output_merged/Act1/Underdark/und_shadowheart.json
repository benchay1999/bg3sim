      "reasoning": "Analyzing the two sessions reveals that they are alternatives triggered by the same action. 'PAD_RefuseNobleStalk' occurs when Shadowheart explicitly refuses to eat the noblestalk, indicating that Shadowheart is either unwilling or not ready, whereas 'PAD_NobleStalk' acts as a fallback in case the desired memory stalk dialog does not start. This indicates a mutual exclusivity: if one is triggered, the other should not occur. There is no logical requirement for one session to precede the other, as each represents an alternative outcome of the same in-game action.",
