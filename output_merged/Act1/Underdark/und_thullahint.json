The SurvivalCheck_PAD session is triggered later when the player interacts with the tracked clues and must pass a survival check to identify the tracks. Therefore, the PAD session must occur first since it establishes the context and evidence required for the SurvivalCheck_PAD session. There are no mutual exclusivity constraints between these sessions because one directly leads into the other rather than being alternative paths.",
