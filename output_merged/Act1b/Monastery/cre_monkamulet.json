      "reasoning": "Both sessions involve the spirit inside the sentient amulet reacting to relics related to Lathander. In the AD_StatueBanter session, the spirit sees a statue that used to be revered by pilgrims, though it turns out to be a fake relic. In the AD_BloodOfLathanderBanter session, the true relic, the Blood of Lathander, is revealed. It makes narrative sense that the spirit\u2019s reminiscence regarding the fake relic (the statue) would come before encountering the true relic. There is no indication that these sessions cannot coexist \u2013 rather, they appear to form consecutive layered pieces of the same story. Thus, AD_StatueBanter should occur before AD_BloodOfLathanderBanter.",
