The session 'DaisyAD_ThroughPrison' is triggered when the player goes through prison, and then later the session 'DaisyAD_ThroughHole' is triggered upon arrival in the colony by going through the tower hole after having gone through prison. In contrast, 'DaisyAD_ThroughHole_SkippedPrison' is triggered on arrival in the colony when the player goes through the tower hole but does not go through prison. Thus, if the player goes through prison, they will experience 'DaisyAD_ThroughPrison' followed by 'DaisyAD_ThroughHole'. If not, they instead trigger 'DaisyAD_ThroughHole_SkippedPrison'. This makes the session 'DaisyAD_ThroughHole' (and its preceding 'DaisyAD_ThroughPrison') mutually exclusive with the session 'DaisyAD_ThroughHole_SkippedPrison'.",
