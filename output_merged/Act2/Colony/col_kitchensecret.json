This status is applied or removed upon gaining the \"Eldritch Pleasure\" buff bestowed by the aura effect of the Resonance Stone, and will only play once per user and nearby player. The removal dialog will only trigger upon losing the buff while inside a trigger near the Colony kitchen, as to avoid it playing unexpectedly during later parts of the game.",

The Resonance Stone can be picked up and may give the Eldritch Pleasure buff to those nearby the player carrying the stone. The removal dialog will only trigger upon losing the buff while inside a trigger near the Colony kitchen."
