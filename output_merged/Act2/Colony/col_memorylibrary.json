As they do not have a tadpole, they can't read the script, and will remark on this. A different Arcana Check occurs in script, and the resulting AD from this check will also play again everytime they try to read an illithid manuscript afterwards.So for non-tadpoled companions (no ILLITHID tag) this dialog is repeatable, but not for tadpoled companions.",
        "how_to_trigger": "Go to the lower floor of the Colony, find the Memory Library (approx. 670; -44; -10) and interact with \"S_COL_MemLib_Manuscript_002\".For tadpoled companions (most of them), this Arcana Check happens after reading one of the illithid manuscripts.Non-tadpoled companions (Jaheira or Halsin) will have the Arcana Check upon interacting with the manuscripts, but are not able to read them. They will see the same dialog from the Arcana Check result every time they try to read it again.The tadpoled and non-tadpoled Arcana Checks are technically two distinct checks, so the results of the checks do not cross over between those different groups of companions."

      "reasoning": "Both sessions are ultimately triggered by encountering an illithid manuscript. In the case of 'AD_ButcherReadsManuscript', the prerequisites are that Chop \u2013 the Colony Butcher \u2013 has been recruited (which requires a successful ILLITHID roll) and that you then have him interact with a manuscript. In contrast, 'PAD_Manuscripts' plays a dialog that occurs when a companion (depending on whether they are tadpoled or not) reads a manuscript in the Colony\u2019s lower Memory Library, triggering an Arcana check. Thus, both sessions are indirectly dependent on the act of reading an illithid manuscript. Moreover, for tadpoled companions the dialog shown by 'PAD_Manuscripts' is designed to trigger only once (or not at all if someone else already succeeded the check), which in a party where Chop triggers his specialized dialogue ('AD_ButcherReadsManuscript') prevents the manuscript check dialog from repeating on tadpoled companions. In that sense, if the conditions to run 'AD_ButcherReadsManuscript' are met (i.e. Chop is recruited and reads the manuscript), then for that branch of the story the general manuscript dialog ('PAD_Manuscripts') is effectively bypassed. Therefore, there is an ordering constraint in that before 'AD_ButcherReadsManuscript' can be triggered, you must have recruited Chop and read a manuscript. Likewise, 'PAD_Manuscripts' cannot happen until a manuscript is read in the Memory Library. Also, from a narrative standpoint these two dialogs are mutually exclusive for a given character path \u2013 specifically for tadpoled companions \u2013 since triggering Chop\u2019s dialog (and his specialized reaction) precludes the repeatable Arcana check dialog from activating for that same branch.",
