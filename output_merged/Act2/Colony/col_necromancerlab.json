      "reasoning": "Analyzing the four sessions reveals that most of the narrative takes place around the necromancer\u2019s lab and its dreadful ritual processes. The session 'PAD_RitualArea' describes the ritual setup where people are captured, drained of life, and turned into undead. In the other two sessions \u2013 'AD_Zombie' and 'AD_AstarionImmune' \u2013 we see different reactions or outcomes unfolding in that same environment. In 'AD_Zombie' the player interacts with one of the zombies created by the lab\u2019s processes, while in 'AD_AstarionImmune', Astarion is shown to be unaffected (even immune) to the draining effect because he is undead. Given that the ritual area (cause) logically should be encountered before witnessing its results (the zombie encounter or Astarion\u2019s immunity), it makes sense that 'PAD_RitualArea' should precede both 'AD_Zombie' and 'AD_AstarionImmune'. Furthermore, the two outcomes \u2013 interacting with a zombie ('AD_Zombie') versus encountering Astarion in the draining cell ('AD_AstarionImmune') \u2013 are reached through separate trigger conditions (different debug commands and approaches). Thus they represent mutually exclusive narrative paths, because if one is experienced, the other is not reached in the same playthrough. The session 'AD_MintharaEntersLab' lacks details or clear ties to any order so it is omitted from the ordering and exclusiveness constraints.",
