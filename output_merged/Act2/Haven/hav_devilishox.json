      "reasoning": "Reviewing the session data shows that the narrative around the infernal (or devilish) ox can follow distinct, branching paths. In one branch the player chooses to engage the ox in combat in the stables of the Last Light Inn. This triggers the session PAD_DeathReaction. In an alternative branch the player can instead walk past the stables and, via an insight check, realize that the ox is the same one encountered earlier (in Druid\u2019s Grove), triggering PAD_SecondInsight. These two sessions (PAD_DeathReaction and PAD_SecondInsight) are mutually exclusive since one represents actively fighting and killing the creature in the stables while the other represents observing it (and not engaging it in combat). Furthermore, there is a later session AD_WeaponSmithReactionToOx that is triggered when the player kills the ox later in Haven. Logically, if the player has already killed the creature in the stables (PAD_DeathReaction), then the Haven encounter cannot occur. Thus, AD_WeaponSmithReactionToOx can only follow the observational branch (when PAD_SecondInsight is triggered) and the eventual kill in Haven. In summary, the ordering and exclusivity rules determined are that if the player chooses to observe (triggering PAD_SecondInsight), then later killing the ox in Haven will trigger AD_WeaponSmithReactionToOx. On the other hand, if the player kills the ox in the stables (triggering PAD_DeathReaction), then PAD_SecondInsight and AD_WeaponSmithReactionToOx cannot occur.",
