      "reasoning": "Both sessions involve the same event where the player engages in combat with the immortal Ketheric Daisy, and the content is virtually identical. However, one is labeled as the original encounter (DaisyAD_AttackImmortal), and the other is marked as 'Repeated' (DaisyAD_AttackImmortalRepeated). This implies that the first session is triggered initially when the event occurs, and if the player repeats the same action (for example, attempting combat again), the repeated version of the session will occur. This establishes an ordering constraint where the repeated session logically follows after the original session. Additionally, in a single continuous narrative sequence the same encounter will not show both versions simultaneously, meaning that in any given encounter only one of them should trigger. Although this could be seen as mutually exclusive in terms of narrative triggering, the primary constraint is the ordering (the repeated version only comes after an initial encounter has occurred).",
