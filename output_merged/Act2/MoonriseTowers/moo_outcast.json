Each session represents the first combat encounter for either Ketheric or Zrell when that state is active, implying that in a single playthrough only one of these first-combat events will occur. Thus, they are mutually exclusive: triggering one prevents the other from appearing as the 'first combat' event. There is no strict ordering between them as neither causes the other.",
