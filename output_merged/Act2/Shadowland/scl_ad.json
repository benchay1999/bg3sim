    "automatic_ordering": {
      "reasoning": "Almost all the sessions in this dataset are 'ShadowMemory' entries that share a nearly identical synopsis and no trigger information that would force an ordering with one another. Their numerical labels (e.g. ShadowMemory1, ShadowMemory2, etc.) do not come with explicit story cues that mandate a strict sequence; they are best viewed as flavor echoes without dependency. In contrast, the three Entrance_Plaque sessions do have differing triggering data and descriptions that allow us to infer a light ordering or exclusivity. In particular, Entrance_Plaque3 is described as a vertical clickable plaque activated via trigger 'SCL_Main_A59 -1166', whereas both Entrance_Plaque1 and Entrance_Plaque2 are rounded clickable plaques in the same location and share the same trigger 'SCL_Main_A75 -1166'. This suggests that Plaque3 is encountered under different circumstances (and likely earlier, given the different trigger code) while only one of Entrance_Plaque1 or Entrance_Plaque2 will be activated in a given playthrough (since they are identical in function and trigger). Thus, we infer that Entrance_Plaque3 should come before either Entrance_Plaque1 or Entrance_Plaque2 (which are mutually exclusive with each other).",
