      "reasoning": "After reviewing the three sessions, we note the following: All sessions are location\u2010based triggers in the same level (SCL_Main_A). 'PAD_Graveyard' specifically occurs when entering the graveyard outside Haven and favors a Dark Urge storyline, while the other two sessions, 'PAD_DeadDruids' and 'PAD_ShadowlandDevastation', consist of generic environmental commentary on the aftermath of ancient events. There is no clear cause\u2013effect relationship between these sessions (i.e. none is described as a consequence of having witnessed another), nor is there an indication that triggering one would block or force the appearance of another. Although the Dark Urge-specific nature of 'PAD_Graveyard' suggests it might be available only on particular character paths, the provided information does not present an explicit ordering or mutual exclusiveness rule between it and the other sessions.",
