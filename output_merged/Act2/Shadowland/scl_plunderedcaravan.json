      "reasoning": "Reading the synopses shows two connected lines of investigation. First, the session 'PAD_InvestigatedOx' has the player investigate a dead ox that was part of a tiefling refugee caravan \u2013 an event that is mentioned as being linked to later events. Next, 'PAD_InvestigatedTiefling' concerns finding a dead tiefling, with the synopsis explicitly stating that the tiefling was killed by the shadowcursed ox. This clearly implies that the ox investigation (PAD_InvestigatedOx) must have happened (or at least its facts uncovered) before the investigation into the tiefling\u2019s death can be fully understood\u2014hence an order dependency between these two sessions. In contrast, the 'PAD_InvestigatedKidnapping' session deals with finding the place where Zevlor kidnapped tiefling refugees. The kidnapping scenario represents an alternative narrative outcome to finding a tiefling who has been killed by the ox. In a consistent narrative path, if a tiefling is found dead due to the ox\u2019s involvement, then the story involving a successful kidnapping (with survivors abducted) would not occur. Therefore, the sessions 'PAD_InvestigatedKidnapping' and 'PAD_InvestigatedTiefling' should be mutually exclusive.",
