      "reasoning": "From the session descriptions we can infer some cause\u2010and\u2010effect relationships and alternative routes. First, the grave and tombstone scenes are connected: the player must find the grave (PAD_DiscoverGrave) before being in a position to examine its tombstone (AD_ReadTombstone). When reading the Skeptical Robber\u2019s note (PAD_ReadRobbersNote), the game checks if the player already discovered the grave or already found the ring \u2013 that is, if the player has triggered either the grave/tombstone events (PAD_DiscoverGrave and AD_ReadTombstone) or one of the ring discovery events. There are two ways to find the ring: either by discovering the burrow directly (PAD_DiscoverBurrow) or by following the footprints (PAD_FoundFootprints), and since obtaining the ring by one route means the other isn\u2019t triggered in that playthrough, these two are mutually exclusive. Therefore, the ordering constraints are: (1) PAD_DiscoverGrave must occur before AD_ReadTombstone. (2) PAD_ReadRobbersNote is only triggered after the player has either discovered the grave (or its tombstone) or obtained the ring (via PAD_DiscoverBurrow or PAD_FoundFootprints). Finally, because the ring\u2013related actions come from two exclusive methods, PAD_DiscoverBurrow and PAD_FoundFootprints cannot both happen in the same storyline.",
