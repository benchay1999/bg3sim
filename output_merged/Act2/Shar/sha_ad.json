      "reasoning": "Examining the provided sessions reveals several narrative cues that imply an order in which these plaques might be encountered in the game. The EntranceSharPlaque is described as a plaque below a painting at the temple entrance, making it natural to be encountered before venturing deeper into the Shar temple. HQ_Plaque1 is located in a central hall of the temple, suggesting that it follows after the entrance. Further inside, TrialsPlaque1 appears just before the section dedicated to trial areas, and NightsongPrison_Plaque1 is positioned near the soul cage prior to the final trial, establishing a clear sequence from TrialsPlaque1 to NightsongPrison_Plaque1. Additionally, the sessions OathPlaque and OathPlaque2 both detail the first part of the Oath of Eternal Shadow and appear to serve the same narrative purpose \u2013 meaning that in any given playthrough, only one of these plaques should appear; they are mutually exclusive.",
