      "reasoning": "The PAD_BrokenMirrorOfLoss session involves the player approaching the mirror and making an arcana check. Its how_to_trigger code includes '-644; -25; -736'. The AD_ShutteredMirrorOfLoss session is a narrator dialogue session that also references the same numbers '(-644; -25; -736)' in its trigger code. This suggests that the AD session is meant to follow the PAD session, likely as a consequence or continuation of the event started in PAD_BrokenMirrorOfLoss. Therefore, the ordering constraint is that PAD_BrokenMirrorOfLoss must occur before AD_ShutteredMirrorOfLoss. There aren\u2019t any mutually exclusive conditions indicated between these two sessions.",
