For example, both PAD_OpenedScrollDoor and AD_RiddlePlaque are triggered in the same area (SCL_Main_A) and while they may happen in the same vicinity it is not clearly indicated that one must happen before the other. Similarly, PAD_SpearLoot (triggered by picking up the Spear of the Night) and AD_SilencePlayer (a combat reaction in the Silent Library) are independent events triggered under different circumstances. No session\u2019s trigger seems to preclude the other; there are no descriptions indicating that, if one occurs, another cannot (or must) happen. Hence, no ordering or mutual exclusiveness constraints can be conclusively established.",
