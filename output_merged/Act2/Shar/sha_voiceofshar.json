      "reasoning": "Looking at the triggers and synopses, we can infer two ordering rules. First, AD_Welcome is played when the player opens the temple gate, while AD_Baptism is triggered upon reaching the inner sanctum (Nightsong's Prison). Logically the welcome must occur before the baptism, as the player must enter the temple (and be welcomed) before advancing to inner areas. Second, AD_TrialIntro is triggered at the beginning of a trial \u2013 it only plays if the trial has not been started yet \u2013 while AD_ProgressionCommentary is activated later (after a trial is completed or upon killing the Orthon) to comment on the player's progress. In a trial branch, it is natural that the trial is introduced (AD_TrialIntro) and then, after some progress, commented on (AD_ProgressionCommentary). None of the sessions appear to be mutually exclusive in that they cannot both be triggered in the same playthrough; the other sessions (like PAD_VoiceReaction) are situational but do not conflict with the narrative order of the above sessions. Therefore, the ordering constraints are as follows.",
