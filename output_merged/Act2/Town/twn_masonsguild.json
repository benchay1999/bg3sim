Thus, they cannot appear together in a single playthrough. Moreover, the AD_MasonPlaque session seems to be a location-based dialogue within the Mason's Guild (triggered by teleporting to the plaque area) and logically would come after the guild entrance has been experienced (i.e. after either of the entrance sessions). Therefore, AD_MasonPlaque should follow either PAD_Entrance_1P or PAD_Entrance_2P.",
