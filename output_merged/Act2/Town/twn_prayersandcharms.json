Given that they provide the same narrative information about a wall with protective charms at Ketheric's Outpost, it is likely that in any one playthrough only one version (either the 1P or the 2P session) should be triggered. This makes them mutually exclusive. There are no indications of a cause-and-effect sequence between these two sessions.",
