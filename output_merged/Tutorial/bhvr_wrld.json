        "synopsis": "If players start game without Shadowheart as avatar, we have her in a pod in the tutorial. The pod is locked and players will be able to choose to find a way to unlock it to free her. While locked inside, Laezel is screaming and hitting the interior of the pod. While screaming, she is also yelling repeatedly to get the player's attention.To put her in the pod we make her use an invisible 'bed' that is inside the pod, so bear that in mind. Shadowheart could be looking around, hitting with her fists It is a tense situation, Shadowheart has woken up to be imprisoned in a mind-flayer pod and can't get out.",
