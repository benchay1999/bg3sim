=== Session: AD_BanditReaction ===
Synopsis: A bandit exclaims in alarm/indignity upon spotting the player 'trespassing' near a tomb they intended to loot.

Gimblebock, Quelenna, Taman, Warryn: Hold it! Not another step! || [context] NodeContext: Anger/alarm

=== Session: VB_Fissure_1 ===
Synopsis: The player notices a gap in the flooring of an ancient chapel. There's faint signs of something else below.

Player: There's something underneath here...

=== Session: EntranceDoor ===
Synopsis: This is the same character as Andorn, the bandit guard within the chapel.

This character is talking to the players through a door - he's locked the door and is on the other side, so they'll be talking TO the door and can't see him.

The player is talking to a gullible bandit through a door - the bandit is inside a chapel dungeon and his friends are outside. The player has probably either killed them or scared them away at this point. The guard is not very bright...

GROUP_Act1_CHA_FL1_BanditGuard: That you, Gimblebock? Everything all right out there? || [context] NodeContext: Speaking to players through a locked door. He's reacting to them trying to open it and thinks they're his accomplice, a gnome called Gimblebock (ɡɪmbəl-bock)
Player: Let me in, now.
: 
GROUP_Act1_CHA_FL1_BanditGuard: Yeah? I've got plenty more friends - come in here and you can meet 'em... || [context] NodeContext: Speaking to players through a locked door. Just found out his friends have been 'dealt with' by the player but feels relatively safe behind the door and is threatening. With a hint of bluffing.

=== Session: AD_BanditsDiscussion ===
Synopsis: Discussion between Gimbleboc and Taman before the scene against them triggers. They're arguing about whether to investigate the crash (this segues into the beginning of their intertactive dialogue when you get near enough)

Gimblebock: Hells. Pity you aren't as good at graverobbing as you are at excuses. || [context] NodeContext: Short-tempered
Taman: Just being careful. Like my mum always said, fools rush in. || [context] NodeContext: Cautious, defensive

=== Session: VB_LockpickingShadowheart_1_WithShadowheart ===
Synopsis: Shadowheart lockpicked the crypt door that she usually try to bash.

Shadowheart: There! Not so impregnable after all. || [context] NodeContext: Satisfied. She's just successfully lockpicked a large, heavy set of doors.

=== Session: BanditInteraction ===
Synopsis: The bandits are encountered near an abandoned chapel and are in the middle of an argument among themselves about whether or not to investigate (and loot) the crashed nautoloid (a spaceship) when the player approaches them. The player can convince them to clear off via lies or threats, or else is forced to fight them. A gnome named Gimblebock is in charge of this group, with his underlings, Quelanna and/or Taman, chiming in at points with their concerns.

Gimblebock: ...You're both twice as tall as me but have half the bloody backbone! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Custom scene setupNodeContext: bandit leader speaking to his crew - annoyed with them. He's a gnome, braver than the taller characters
Taman: But we don't know what that thing even is! And what about the crypt? || [context] NodeContext: Arguing for caution - they've never seen the likes of the ship that crashed before. It could be dangerous.
Gimblebock: I'm telling you - it's a ship. || [context] NodeContext: the 'crypt' is inside the chapel they're standing outside. 'Thing' refers back to that. 'STOP!" is him interrupting himself because he's just seen the players approaching
Gimblebock: And the crypt can wait! Mari and Barton have been trying to break in for days. Now we - Stop!
Gimblebock: Got ourselves competition already! That's our ship! || [context] NodeContext: 'competition' refers to the players. He's seen them coming
Player: The only thing you own is your life. Leave before I take that, too.
: True
Gimblebock: Well, uh, in that case... || [context] NodeContext: We scared the gnome off from attacking us or investigating the crashed ship, though he doesn't really want to show it too much.
Gimblebock: C'mon, you lot, no point in gettin' killed. Second worm gets the cheese, an' all... || [context] NodeContext: He's still a little bit shaken from our intimidation, but tries to get over it, by proposing to wait the danger out.
Taman: Uh, second mouse gets the cheese, no? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Underling hesitantly chimes in, correcting the gnome's mixed metaphor.NodeContext: Hesitantly chiming in to correct the boss's mixed metaphor: 'the second worm gets the cheese'.
Gimblebock: Nobody's getting any damn cheese! Now move it! || [context] NodeContext: Annoyed because his underling corrected him on mixing up a methaphor. He isn't shouting too lood, because he just got intimidated and doesn't want to make too big of a scene. || [approval] ['Gale 1', 'Shadowheart 1', 'Wyll 1', 'Karlach -1']

=== Session: AD_Bandit_Melee_02_CrushedReaction ===
Synopsis: A bandit sees the corpse of one of his companions, killed by a falling boulder

Taman: We'd have been safer in the crypt! || [context] NodeContext: reacting with shock on seeing a dead friend

=== Session: AD_Bandit_Melee_01_CrushedReaction ===
Synopsis: A bandit sees one of his friends crushed (dead) by a boulder and doesn't have a great deal of sympathy

Gimblebock: How the hells did that happen?! || [context] NodeContext: seeing a companion crushed by a boulder - he thinks it was an accident but is unnerved

=== Session: AD_Bandit_Caster_01_CrushedReaction ===
Synopsis: A bandit reacts to finding one of her companions dead in an apparent accident. She looks on the bright side.

Quelenna: Well, that's one less greedy bastard to share the loot with. || [context] NodeContext: with a shrug - found a dead companion and sees the bright side
