=== Session: AD_BanditReaction ===
Synopsis: A bandit exclaims in alarm/indignity upon spotting the player 'trespassing' near a tomb they intended to loot.

Gimblebock, Quelenna, Taman, Warryn: Hold it! Not another step! || [context] NodeContext: Anger/alarm

=== Session: VB_Fissure_1 ===
Synopsis: The player notices a gap in the flooring of an ancient chapel. There's faint signs of something else below.

Player: There's something underneath here...

=== Session: EntranceDoor ===
Synopsis: This is the same character as Andorn, the bandit guard within the chapel.

This character is talking to the players through a door - he's locked the door and is on the other side, so they'll be talking TO the door and can't see him.

The player is talking to a gullible bandit through a door - the bandit is inside a chapel dungeon and his friends are outside. The player has probably either killed them or scared them away at this point. The guard is not very bright...

GROUP_Act1_CHA_FL1_BanditGuard: That you, Gimblebock? Everything all right out there? || [context] NodeContext: Speaking to players through a locked door. He's reacting to them trying to open it and thinks they're his accomplice, a gnome called Gimblebock (ɡɪmbəl-bock)

=== Session: VB_LockpickingCrypt_1_WithShadowheart ===
Synopsis: The player lockpicked the crypt door that shadowheart was trying to bash.
