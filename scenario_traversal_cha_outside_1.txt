=== Session: AD_BanditsDiscussion ===
Synopsis: Discussion between Gimbleboc and Taman before the scene against them triggers. They're arguing about whether to investigate the crash (this segues into the beginning of their intertactive dialogue when you get near enough)

Gimblebock: Either we act now, or someone else will pick that wreck clean and leave us nothing. || [context] NodeContext: Short-tempered
Taman: Haven't seen anyone but us. It's just wilderness out here. || [context] NodeContext: Cautious, defensive

=== Session: VB_LockpickingShadowheart_1_WithShadowheart ===
Synopsis: Shadowheart lockpicked the crypt door that she usually try to bash.

Shadowheart: There! Not so impregnable after all. || [context] NodeContext: Satisfied. She's just successfully lockpicked a large, heavy set of doors.

=== Session: AD_BanditReaction ===
Synopsis: A bandit exclaims in alarm/indignity upon spotting the player 'trespassing' near a tomb they intended to loot.

Gimblebock, Quelenna, Taman, Warryn: Hold it! Not another step! || [context] NodeContext: Anger/alarm

=== Session: AD_Boulder ===
Synopsis: Players are investigating a loose boulder outside a chapel that can be shifted to smash through into the crypts below

Player: Wouldn't take much to send that stone crashing downwards... || [context] NodeContext: Investigating a large piece of masonry suspended from a wooden crane.

=== Session: BanditInteraction ===
Synopsis: The bandits are encountered near an abandoned chapel and are in the middle of an argument among themselves about whether or not to investigate (and loot) the crashed nautoloid (a spaceship) when the player approaches them. The player can convince them to clear off via lies or threats, or else is forced to fight them. A gnome named Gimblebock is in charge of this group, with his underlings, Quelanna and/or Taman, chiming in at points with their concerns.

Gimblebock: ...You're both twice as tall as me but have half the bloody backbone! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Custom scene setupNodeContext: bandit leader speaking to his crew - annoyed with them. He's a gnome, braver than the taller characters
Taman: But we don't know what that thing even is! And what about the crypt? || [context] NodeContext: Arguing for caution - they've never seen the likes of the ship that crashed before. It could be dangerous.
Gimblebock: I'm telling you - it's a ship. || [context] NodeContext: the 'crypt' is inside the chapel they're standing outside. 'Thing' refers back to that. 'STOP!" is him interrupting himself because he's just seen the players approaching
Gimblebock: And the crypt can wait! Mari and Barton have been trying to break in for days. Now we - Stop!
Gimblebock: Got ourselves competition already! That's our ship! || [context] NodeContext: 'competition' refers to the players. He's seen them coming
Player: Attack. || [approval] ['Astarion 1', "Lae'zel 1", 'Wyll 1', 'Karlach 1']

=== Session: AD_Bandit_Melee_02_CrushedReaction ===
Synopsis: A bandit sees the corpse of one of his companions, killed by a falling boulder

Taman: We'd have been safer in the crypt! || [context] NodeContext: reacting with shock on seeing a dead friend

=== Session: AD_Bandit_Melee_01_CrushedReaction ===
Synopsis: A bandit sees one of his friends crushed (dead) by a boulder and doesn't have a great deal of sympathy

Gimblebock: How the hells did that happen?! || [context] NodeContext: seeing a companion crushed by a boulder - he thinks it was an accident but is unnerved

=== Session: Bandit_Melee_01_Dead ===
Synopsis: Speak with Dead dialogue with Gimblebock - the leader of the bandits who're looting the ruined chapel near where the player first wakes up. Gimblebock's answers are fragmented, cryptic. He can only draw on info that he knew when he was alive, and will refuse to speak to his killer if he recognises them. After a maximum of five questions, he'll fall silent for good.

Narrator: *The corpse regards you lifelessly.*
Player: What were you doing here?
Gimblebock: Looting... chapel ruins...
