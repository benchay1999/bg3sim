Bex: What about you? Big plans for when you get to the city? || [context] NodeContext: Friendly curiosity
Player: I'll be keeping to myself. People tend to stare at me.
Danis: Know what you mean.
Bex: Do we ever.
Danis: But... I've heard there's all sorts in the city. It might not be like it was in Elturel. I mean - in Baldur's Gate, they give you a chance.

======== Scenario: den_prodigy ========
Session Sequence: Group -> AD -> Sister -> Brother
----- Session: Group -----
Synopsis: Three people are having an argument. Rolan, Lia and Cal. Lia and Cal are brother and sister, but the three of them have grown up together. They're young, talented tieflings who are heading to Baldur's Gate to start their lives and careers. Rolan argues that they should leave now and get to the city while they still can. Lia argues that it is irresponsible to leave their kin behind. Cal is stuck in the middle.
This is a passionate and fiery argument, both sides are convinced that they are correct.

Lia: Hells, we can't just leave. They're kin. || [context] NodeContext: This is the start of the dialog but clearly an ongoing argument. You think it's your responsibility, as a tiefling, to stay and help your kin. You're angry, voice is level but will soon grow louder, and utterly convinced that staying at the camp is the right thing to do.
Rolan: I'll not gamble our lives, our futures, on people who are as good as dead. We must leave for Baldur's Gate - at once. || [context] NodeContext: You're angry but your voice is level. You think staying at the camp is essentially suicide. You cannot believe it was even suggested. You and your friends have brand new lives waiting for you in Baldur's Gate - to stay at the camp is reckless and pointless to you.
Cal: Can we all just take a moment? Please? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Looking for one to the other. Stuck in between them, pleading. Hands out as he tries to calm the situation. NodeContext: Your friend and sister are screaming at each other in front of you. Light and easygoing tone as you try to calm the argument.
Lia: What's the point in blades and spells if we don't bloody use them? We should stay. || [context] NodeContext: Your voice is getting louder. You're very angry now. It's your civic duty to use the skills you have to help people. You cannot believe how selfish Rolan is being.
Lia: These people aren't fighters. We can help. || [context] NodeContext: Ibid.
Cal: Or yell louder. That's fine too. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Sighing as he shrugs. He knows neither is listening to him. NodeContext: Your friend and sister have ignored your plea. You know once they've started they'll just keep arguing until one of them gives in. This is almost said with a shrug and in a light, jokey tone.
Player: You should all stay. A single blade could make a difference. || [approval] ['Gale 1', 'Karlach 1']
: False
Rolan: No. This place is a death trap. Let us leave - immediately! || [context] NodeContext: Player has disagreed with you. You're frustrated and angry. You think it's ludicrous that anyone would disagree with you.
Rolan: Or would you deny your brother here his chance at fortune in Baldur's Gate? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Looking at Lia but gesturing to Cal. NodeContext: You know the argument is likely going your way and you're being a little bit of a dick here. You know mentioning Lia's brother is a guarantee that she'll give in to your side and leave with you. It's a bit of an underhanded move.
Player: You want fortune? There's coin in it if you stay.
Lia: You know, that money could go towards a spiffy new outfit for your apprenticeship...? || [context] NodeContext: Smile, knowing rolan will give in
Rolan: Zurgan. Fine. Give it here. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Generic 'taking' animation. Taking coin from the player.NodeContext: 'ZUR-gan.' Frustrated but giving in to the promise of going.
Rolan: If we survive, it'll make for a good story I suppose... || [context] NodeContext: Kinda sulky but accepting that you'll stay in the grove.
Lia: Thank you, Rolan. And thank you, friend. || [context] NodeContext: Warm and sincere. Directed at rolan and then player.

----- Session: AD -----
Synopsis: This occurs betwen Lia, Cal and Ronan. There are mixed ADs which occur - when they're arguing about when to stay and go, when they've decided to stay and when they've decided to go.

Rolan: We should add the Elfsong Tavern to the list. || [context] NodeContext: Talking about things to do in Baldur's Gate - excited.
Lia: So long as you're paying. || [context] NodeContext: A wry smile, you're happy to see your Rolan so excited.
Cal: Drinks on Rolan? Count me in. || [context] NodeContext: Your sister has conned Rolan into paying - you're teasing him.

Nadira: Now take my regards back to that pouting erinyes and leave me alone. || [context] NodeContext: Very flat, almost cold.

Lines play sequentially, each druid saying one line, then the next, etc.They're chanting at a normal to low volume. They're attempting to suss power out from the earth itself, but they're not forcing it out. There should be a loose rhythm to it (think Arwen from LoTR when she summons the river horses), but it shouldn't come across like a drum circle.

Aelar, Karrik, Inwe, Tahan, Elwyn: Ab spiritu humoque, aculeus vitisque. || [context] NodeContext: Chanting a magic spell: Ahb SPEE-ree-too oo-MOHK, AH-coo-lay-oos VEE-tees-kway.

Kerrick is furious - he feels betrayed by Kagha, and doesn't quite care if she's been killed.In the third, a group of goblins that had threatened the grove has been dealt with and the grove is considered safe again.

Karrik: We wasted so much time fighting each other. || [context] NodeContext: The danger has passed, but there was much infighting in the druid grove, which he believes put them at higher risk.

In this state, Tahani isn't convinced the threat is really over. She thinks her fellow druids will lead them down the same path again, taking pity on people that will only bring trouble to their door.The player always encounters Inwe around a sacred druid pool. She's more or less the xenophobic conservative of the chanting druids.

Tahan: You think you saved us? You just prolonged the inevitable. || [context] NodeContext: The ritual has stopped and the goblin threat against the grove is dealt with, but she believes something similar will happen again so long as her fellow druids let outsiders in.
Tahan: Sooner or later, other outsiders will bring trouble to the grove. || [context] NodeContext: The ritual has stopped and the goblin threat against the grove is dealt with, but she believes something similar will happen again so long as her fellow druids let outsiders in.

She's overcome with shame for being a part of a shadow druid plot.The second state plays once the goblins that threatened the grove - and necessitated the ritual - have been dealt with. In this state, Inwe isn't quite convinced the danger is over. She's jumping at shadows, imagining danger where there's presumably none.

She's shocked at the revelation that Kagha had been involved with Shadow Druids, and is having trouble accepting it.The player finds this druid speaking to a bird in the druid grove.

Apikusis: Speak.
Player: What were you saying to that bird?
Apikusis: The bird knows. She needs to know. You do not.
Player: Hmm... Suspicious. Do the other druids know? Because I could tell them.

Synopsis: In these dialogues, Zevlor reflects on what's happened (an attack of goblins at the gate, which the player helped with) and his mistrust of and bitterness towards the druids who are reluctantly hosting his people. He is exasperated, furious, but also eager to meet anyone who could help. In the same dialogue, we can also uncover that he is in fact a traitor, concerned only with getting these people through the goblins so he can trade them for his own safety later. In truth he is resentful and contemptuous of them, viewing them as weak.

Player: Just passing through.
Zevlor: Right. Best not to stop here. || [context] NodeContext: Matter-of-fact. Playuer isn't being particularly friendly, so neither is zevlor
Zevlor: Whatever your business here, I'd see to it quickly - the druids are forcing everyone out. || [context] NodeContext: Serious - knows he's delivering bad news
Zevlor: This latest attack will only strengthen their resolve. || [context] NodeContext: Wary, tired - knows the druids will be furious about the goblin attack and blame his people

Player: Leave. || [approval] ['Shadowheart 1', 'Wyll -1', 'Karlach -1']

Sapper Gald: This is where it gets good.

======== Scenario: gob_orpheus ========
Session Sequence: PAD_AbsoluteHuntsBox
----- Session: PAD_AbsoluteHuntsBox -----
Synopsis: The party reflects on learning that they are being hunted by the followers of the Absolute for the 'weapon' they have - in fact the strange artefact that protected them from the mysterious Voice when they first reached the temple.This can occur after meeting with Dror Ragzlin or Minthara.

Player: They're seeking a weapon. I wonder if they mean that odd artefact...
Player: If that's the case, we've got more problems than just the worms in our heads.

======== Scenario: gob_halsin ========
Session Sequence: PAD_EnteringGoblinCamp
----- Session: PAD_EnteringGoblinCamp -----
Synopsis: Thematically, this VB is a conversation about the goblin camp and how difficult it might be to find the druid there. Player will be aware that he's being held captive somewhere in the camp and can see the goblins's strength.This occurs over walking into a trigger, so lines between speaker 1 and speaker 2 can be fairly opinionated.

Player: The druid Halsin is in here somewhere.
Player: Let's hope we find him in one piece.

--- Scenario Details ---
======== Scenario: gob_prisonescape ========
Session Sequence: Tunnel -> Guard -> PAD_TunnelBlocked
----- Session: Tunnel -----
Synopsis: A body is found protruding out of a tunnel in the GOB prison. For patch 6: After pulling the body out, the player can use the tunnel to instantly escape. Patch 7: the player will need to find a shovel to dig their way out, but this will be outside the dialogue.

Narrator: *Decaying legs protrude from the hole - a failed escape, it seems.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: See the legs sticking out of the hole
Player: Inspect the body.
: True
Narrator: *It seems the tunnel collapsed mid-dig and suffocated him. A crooked heart is embroidered on his left shoe.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Player is crouched and looking intently at the body

----- Session: Guard -----
Synopsis: Warrior Plig is a goblin on patrol around the wolf pens in the goblin camp. She's bored and wishing for some action.

Warrior Plig: Steal somethin' or act the bollocks, will ya? I'm itching to throw someone in the brig. It'll be fun. I promise. || [context] NodeContext: plig wants the player to act out so she can throw them in jail

----- Session: PAD_TunnelBlocked -----
Synopsis: The player has pulled the body from the tunnel in the goblin prison, but it's still blocked by debris. The player can attack it if they can do enough damage (vulnrable to Force damge), are small enough to get good levrage, or shapeshifted into a badger.

Synopsis: This occurs as Abdirak is beating the player. Breathless with excitement. Reveling in the act of penance - think preacher in 'god will save us, save us ALL!' mode as he, well, beats the crap out of the player. All of his reactions should be manic, joyous and vaguely sexual. Player is in front of him, facing a wall as he raises his weapon and beats the player. The weapon will be either a dagger, handaxe or a scourge.

Abdirak: The pain you suffer will cleanse you - do not fight it. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Weapon in hand (it will be either a dagger, a scourge, or a handaxe).

Abdirak: Sweet child. While I enjoyed that, I'm afraid your reaction was... lacking. || [context] NodeContext: Voice low and intimate. Player did penance but did not react correctly. He regrets that the player does not get a reward (but he had a great time, which is all he really cares abotu)
Abdirak: To gain Loviatar's favour, every single strike should be met with an honest cry of pain - or perhaps a touch of begging.
Abdirak: Nevertheless, thank you. And I pray you've learned from today's little... lesson.

----- Session: VoiceOfAbsolute -----
Synopsis: Before entering the goblin camp, a scene triggers in which the party hear the voice of the Absolute, and experience a vision of its Chosen Three (Ketheric, Gortash and Orin). The voice orders the player to help the three find the Orpheus artefact and to seek 'the path of illumination'.If a party member in the group has the Orpheus box in their inventory, they take it into their hands. It glows brighter and brighter, and then the voice and visions stop. The light from the box then fades, and the player(s) discuss the apparent protection the box provided from the Absolute’s influence.If no party member in the group has the Orpheus box in their inventory,and Shadowheart isn't alive to show up, the visions and voice will cause the party to pass out and experience a forced camp night where they receive the box.NOTE: this dialogue contains narrator nodes that're intended to be player-forward in the medium term until NPC assets are available for cinematics.

Derryth is a bit gruff - she's a healer, but her bedside manner leaves a lot to be desired. She's also a very shrewd businessperson. She's in the underdark to get rich first and foremost.
She treats her business partner (Baelen) like he's an idiot, and pretends not to care about him, but in reality he is the most important person to her in the world.

There's some reactivity depending on whether Baelen has returned to the bonecloak camp or not, and if Baelen recovered his senses by eating the noblestalk mushroom.

 Next block: you have killed all the duergars; now it wants you to kill the sovereign
. 
Final block: you have killed the sovereign and it rewards you. 

This myconid does not speak with the same hive mind voice of the others. He should sound creepy, like FART in Rick and Morty, with a SLIGHT undercurrent of menace.

Ellyka: Hrast, another one! Keep back, flatface - I know how to handle myself! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Ellyka is immediately defensive, brandishing a dagger at the gith player.NodeContext: Hrast pronounced hur-RAST-ing. Similar to damn/fuck in common language.
Player: Take it easy, I'm only disguised as a gith.

Player: Come - we shouldn't linger here.

----- Session: AD_ScoutReactsToDragon -----
Synopsis: A tiefling refugee observes a war party of githyanki warriors guarding a bottleneck in the main road leading out of the region. The githyanki are alien and fearsome to the tiefling. She reacts with shock when she sees how they have a dragon circling overhead in support.

----- Session: ConfrontationLaezel -----
Synopsis: Alternate version of the dragon rider scene at chokepoint. Lae'zel is alive and was never recruited. Player can recruit her after this.

Lae'zel approaches the rider to discover where to find the creche. A cure for the tadpole can be found there - or so she believes. However, the knight is under different orders.

Narrator: *Your skull pounds in response to the githyanki's white-hot stare. Her lips don't move, yet you hear her voice.*
Lae'zel: You. Stay put, and keep your lips sealed.
Lae'zel: Rider - my time is short. Lead me to... || [context] NodeContext: Lae'zel begins to bow as she speaks to the kith'rak

----- Session: CINE_RiderAndDragonLeave -----
Synopsis: Cinematic: Kith'rak Voss flies away on his dragon.The player interrupted the Gith Chokepoint situation. The most likely interruption is triggering a combat (player attacks any npc there including Voss or the dragon, or drags another hostile npc near them)This interruption happens in gameplay, so normally the Rider (Kith'rak Voss) and the Dragon would also leave in gameplay, but animations don't have the tech support to make the Rider ride the dragon like this, so we play this cutscene instead

[desc] CinematicNodeContext: ~The dragon spreads its wings and soars away.
NOTE: this could be used in a number of circumstances in which Voss flies away. Voss is an arrogant senior gith officer, focused on his mission, so he can always depart while being unfazed by preceeding events. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: ~The dragon spreads its wings and soars away.

While reading our thoughts, the githyanki may realise we are tadpoled, resulting in instant combat. If we manage to conceal our tadpoles, they may allow us to pass.

Kith'rak Voss: What easy prey you make, walking right within my blade's embrace.
Kith'rak Voss: These creatures are so simple to ensnare, Baretha. You mewl too much about your task.
Sarth Baretha: Forgiveness, Kith'rak.
Kith'rak Voss: And as for you, tell me - why shouldn't I run you through this instant?
Player: Try it - let's see who walks away alive.

----- Session: AD_StandOff -----
Synopsis: A flaming fist solider nervously attempts to challenge a githyanki warrior. The gith is essentially an alien to the lowly soldier; he can't help but feel intimidated.

Sarth Baretha: Your babbling tires me, istik. Move your carcass! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Authoritative demandingNodeContext: Authoritative demanding. 'istik' =  'Stranger' - Catch-all term for non-gith. Pronounced Iss-tick
Gauntlet Dion: B-by order of the Flaming Fist, halt! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Unintelligent confusionNodeContext: Unintelligent confusion
Sarth Baretha: Or what? Show us what you can do, worm. || [context] NodeContext: Htak'-a meaning "Die!" in gith language

~Idle
Narrator: *Magical energy courses through the slate, then to Lae'zel.*
Narrator: *A mystical map glows before Lae'zel, revealing a githyanki refuge beyond the mountain pass.*
Narrator: *The slate also reveals the githyanki's purpose: they are combing the Sword Coast in search of a polyhedric relic of great importance to their queen.*
Lae'zel: The map is clear - I will soon reach a githyanki crèche. It lies within an ancient temple at the mountain pass.<br>
Lae'zel: I must hurry forth. Purification is at hand.

Synopsis: |Lae'zel Companion only: the player attacked the gith during 'PLA_GithChokepoint_ConfrontationLaezel', and Voss commanded Baretha to kill them all (the player + Lae'zel) OR, the situation naturally ended in combat. Lae'zel is betrayed, and this AD makes it clear to the player.|

Lae'zel: Traitors to our queen: I will make you suffer! || [context] NodeContext: Calls out after battle starts.

----- Session: AD_GithCaptainFirstTurn -----

----- Session: PAD_DragonShadow -----

Player: A dragon-rider. My kin are hunting - blood will be spilled.
Player: A dragon. Gods preserve me. || [context] NodeContext: Unnerved at the sight of a dragon flying overhead

----- Session: PartyReaction -----
Synopsis: Companions react to the gith chokepoint (dragon flew by and killed the flaming fists). Lae'zel is handled in a different dialog.

Player: These gith are formidable - but not infallible. We can take them in battle, should it come to that.
Player: Let's see if they want to have their blood spilled.

----- Session: AD_SearchingCorpses -----
Synopsis: Kith'rak Voss, a high-ranking gith warrior, berates his underling, Sarth Baretha, and orders her and her warriors to search the corpses of some humans they'rve just killed. They are looking for 'the weapon' (in fact a strange puzzle box in the possession of our party).

----- Session: PAD_TadpoleDivine -----
Synopsis: This VB plays after attempting to get Ethel to remove the tadpole. She confesses that there's something special about it and she can't remove it.Will play on the player who leaves the dialog that reveals this fact, but characters can be fairly opinionated here since they are reacting to knowledge.Up to two characters.

Player: The tadpole was tampered with? That complicates things...
Player: Tampered or not, we need to get these things out of our heads. Let's find another way.
