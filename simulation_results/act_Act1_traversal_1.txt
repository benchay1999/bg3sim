Synopsis: death--Jergal--climbs out of his sarcophagus to greet them. He has been locked inside for years by the god Helm to atone for his part in raising the Dead Three, wicked gods who are now plotting to conquer the realms. Jergal is emotionless and excessively formal, both resigned to his fate and that of others. He is here to assist the party because that is his divine oath, not out of any true desire to act. Players can attempt to goad or attack him, but to minimal effect, as he is functionally immortal. His only goal was to see their faces, so he can find them at camp later to offer further assistance.

Withers: We have nothing more to discuss. Continue on thy way, as if I were not here.
Withers: I must attend this place, after so many years away. We will see each other again soon.
Player: You better not follow me. There would be consequences.
Withers: I had no intention of following thee. We will find one another regardless.
Withers: Inevitability is a wheel that turns of its own accord.

----- Session: AD_BanditSanctumAlert -----

Synopsis: Age: mid-30-40s.
Female
Bio: Rough and working-class. A veteran of many expeditions, Remira is nonetheless shaken after a raid gone horribly wrong and trying to hide it behind bravado.

But not Liam, no - he charged them, the stupid bastard. || [context] NodeContext: She's genuinely hurt at the loss of this recruit but projecting a knowing persona to hide it, as if his bravery is somehow a rookie mistake.

--- Scenario Details ---
======== Scenario: gob_quartermasterflimsy ========
Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: A trader from the Zhentarim (z-HENT-ah-rim) , a shady organisation of spies, assassins and dealers in illicit goods. The player may or may not recognise her as such, but either way her attitude is blunt, breezy and unscrupulous. She's there to make money, and you're either there to make a deal or wasting her time - she has absolutely no interest in indecision or moralizing.

Roah Moonglow: That the jingle of coin I hear? You've timed it well, my friend. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Custom CamNodeContext: Warm and welcoming (a kind of mercantile 'Who do we have here?')
Roah Moonglow: Already turned quite the profit today, so I'm feeling generous. || [context] NodeContext: Trying to coax you into a deal
: True
Narrator: *You recognise the crest she bears - the winged serpent of the Zhentarim.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Camera should show Crest of Zhentarim she is wearing
Player: What business does someone like you have in a goblin camp?
Roah Moonglow: You joking? Goblins sell the best prisoners - cheap, quiet, and eager to be elsewhere. || [context] NodeContext: You've made the assumption that there's nothing worth trading with goblins - she's the expert correcting you. As if giving tips to a novice
Roah Moonglow: Till this crowd converted and started sending their captives to Moonrise Towers, at least. || [context] NodeContext: Correcting herself. Tone is rueful - some of her best trading partners have fallen to organised religion.
Roah Moonglow: No complaints, mind - I just sold enough smokepowder to cover the loss ten times over. || [context] NodeContext: Perking up - she still managed to make a profit. Always a bright side.
Player: It's slaves you're buying - not prisoners.
Roah Moonglow: Oh dry your eyes, Ilmater. It's me or a goblin cookpot - I know which I'd choose. || [context] NodeContext: Scornful but not overly so - she's more bored of your moralising than anything. Ilmater (ihl-MAY-ter) is a god of compassion and martyrdom. She has no time for your bleeding heart - she's all pragmatism.
Roah Moonglow: Now - much obliged for the chat, but I'm here to trade. || [context] NodeContext: Insincere about the chat - she's just Impatient to get back to the matter at hand.
Player: Leave.

Synopsis: Warrior Plig is a goblin on patrol around the wolf pens in the goblin camp. She's bored and wishing for some action.

Warrior Plig: Steal somethin' or act the bollocks, will ya? I'm itching to throw someone in the brig. It'll be fun. I promise. || [context] NodeContext: plig wants the player to act out so she can throw them in jail

----- Session: PAD_TunnelBlocked -----
Synopsis: The player has pulled the body from the tunnel in the goblin prison, but it's still blocked by debris. The player can attack it if they can do enough damage (vulnrable to Force damge), are small enough to get good levrage, or shapeshifted into a badger. This AD plays to inform the player the way is still blocked and to hint at the solution.

Player: Still blocked - but should be easy enough to clear.

======== Scenario: gob_raiderstupid ========
Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Goblin is (gleefully) warning player about wandering down into the wolf pens.

Sharp-Eye Eef: Don't worry on the worgs, cavey. They won't eat anyfink wot grows in the ground. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Normal back-and-forth.NodeContext: Takes pleasure in trying to intimidate the player - if the player triggers the Underdark option, he's snide about it as well.
Sharp-Eye Eef: Might still kill ya, mind.

Synopsis: One of the guards at the door to the inner temple. He's been standing here for a while and shouldn've been switched out a while ago, but the change of guard never showed. He's very bored.

Sharp-Eye Nozk: You outsiders never have ta guard the borin' posts.

----- Session: 3way_UpsetAndCapturedGoblins -----
Synopsis: A three-way checkpoint dialog if Sazza (Captured Goblin) was freed in the Den. The guard would usually stop us but instead gives player free access to the Goblin Throne region.

Warrior Trinzas: Oi! Ain't no party in 'ere - || [context] NodeContext: Sudden, barked - she's on guard duty and takes it very seriously, assumes you're a drunkard coming in from the party outside.
Sazza: Shut it, Graw. Olak cleared us - got a visitor for the drow, I do. || [context] NodeContext: As if at a yapping dog. Sazza and Graw have bad blood, and Sazza loves being in a position of authority above her.
Warrior Trinzas: My arse - what's a True Soul want with any mate o' yours? || [context] NodeContext: Disbelieving - to Graw, Sazza is the lowest of the low but has always had high opinion of herself.
Sazza: Private business, that is. Raidin' business. But if anyone wants a pisspot guarded, we'll call. || [context] NodeContext: Putting on airs - Sazza has been chosen to go out on raids, Graw hasn't, and Sazza's rubbing it in.
Warrior Trinzas: Just get your friend branded proper, right Sazza? Got better things to do th- || [context] NodeContext: Disgusted, dismissive. Trying to have the last word and claim a scrap of authority by telling Sazza to the player marked so she doesn't have to stop us again. Cut off at the end by Sazza's reply
Sazza: No you don't. Come on, then. || [context] NodeContext: Dismissive, bored, matter-of-fact. Snubbing Graw and sweeping past, addressing us to follow with the second line.

Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: The scrying eye is a floating eye that acts as a sort of magical security camera. This one is hovering around the goblin camp spying on players and broadcasting back to Moonrise Towers. The presence watching is a drow at moonrise.

Narrator: *The eye's glassy black surface reflects your gaze.* || [context] NodeContext: the 'eye' is large, magical and floating around watching you
: True
Narrator: *As you gaze deeper, you feel a focus. An intent.* || [context] NodeContext: this 'intent' is unnerving
Player: Reach out to the presence.
Narrator: *You feel a brief, lurching connection. The sensation of falling into your own image, endlessly.* || [context] NodeContext: unnerving

Synopsis: A goblin at a party who has had far too much to drink already. He's celebrating the raid in which the goblins stole all of the booze they're now working their way through.

Sharp-Eye Aggy: Awshh... drink's goin' straight through me... || [context] NodeContext: drunk, to the point he's slightly unsteady on his feet
Player: The only cure is drinking more - as fast as you can.
Sharp-Eye Aggy: That's the plan! We looted an entire inn - brought back enough booze to drown a dragon.<br> || [context] NodeContext: drunk - explaining the reasons for the party with respect and excitement

Four: Ugh. You look like you've been kissin' a worg's backside. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: waving his hand in front of his nose, exaggerating a bad smellNodeContext: disgusted and amused - reacting to player having dung smeared on their face. Worg is a wolf-like animal (

Synopsis: After Goblin Hunt Celebration night and persuading Minthara to spare their lives, player can observe Goblin camp being empty with only one goblin trader looting what's rest in the Festivities area.This is that goblin's dialog.

Glomp the looter: How you doing, pal? Looking for some odds and ends? I've scavenged all sorts. || [context] NodeContext: friendly, like a cheeky bloke at a market selling stolen goods
Glomp the looter: Didn't expect to see you grubbing around here in the muck and the leftovers. || [context] NodeContext: friendly
Player: I thought there might be something useful here.
Glomp the looter: There is. Lots. But I've got scavenger's rights, so it's all mine, unless you're willing to trade for it. || [context] NodeContext: friendly

======== Scenario: gob_halsin ========
Session Sequence: PAD_EnteringGoblinCamp
----- Session: PAD_EnteringGoblinCamp -----
Synopsis: Thematically, this VB is a conversation about the goblin camp and how difficult it might be to find the druid there. Player will be aware that he's being held captive somewhere in the camp and can see the goblins's strength.This occurs over walking into a trigger, so lines between speaker 1 and speaker 2 can be fairly opinionated.

Player: The druid Halsin is in here somewhere.
Player: Let's hope we find him in one piece.

Synopsis: Karad is standing around on guard duty, bored.

Karad: Bloody cold down here.

----- Session: Zhent02_CaughtUp -----
Synopsis: The player has snuck into the miiddle of a Zhentarim outpost and been spotted - the Zhent would usually run but choose to fight as the player got too close before discovery. In some cases, friendly members of the group recognise the player.

Zarys: Attack on my mark.<br>
Rugan: What did you have to come creeping in for? Sorry - we'll make this quick.
Zarys: No prisoners! No mercy! Take them!

Synopsis: 

Vol: Didn't I tell you to move along?

----- Session: Zhent03_AD_Idle -----
Synopsis: Brem is chatting to himself as he packs to leave the Zhent hideout.

Brem: Well, won't get that letter sent this side of the Underdark.

Brem: 'At least the mouther had to stop for breath.'

----- Session: AD_InvestigationCheck -----
Synopsis: Player is chasing someone down into a seemingly sealed room - they'll either realise there's another door or just be confused that their quarry has disappeared.

Player: There's a breeze down here. Wonder where it's coming from.

----- Session: Zhent05_AD_Idle -----
Synopsis: Bellar is a cheerfully violent thug who is happily chatting to himself while his companions prepare to flee their hideout.

----- Session: CINE_RiderAndDragonLeave -----
Synopsis: Cinematic: Kith'rak Voss flies away on his dragon.The player interrupted the Gith Chokepoint situation.

Kith'rak Voss: What easy prey you make, walking right within my blade's embrace.
Kith'rak Voss: These creatures are so simple to ensnare, Baretha. You mewl too much about your task.
Sarth Baretha: Forgiveness, Kith'rak.
Kith'rak Voss: And as for you, tell me - why shouldn't I run you through this instant?
Player: You would've done so already if you didn't want something from me first.
: True
Kith'rak Voss: Perceptive, for such an inferior creature.

We can attempt to overpower the Flind psionically, allowing us to control it temporarily in order to destroy the pack of gnolls. If we choose to fight the Flind, we should be prepared for a difficult encounter. It is strong, though far from the most powerful of its kind thanks to the war raging in its brain.

 Next block: you have killed all the duergars; now it wants you to kill the sovereign
. 
Final block: you have killed the sovereign and it rewards you. 

This myconid does not speak with the same hive mind voice of the others. He should sound creepy, like FART in Rick and Morty, with a SLIGHT undercurrent of menace.

Player: Are you always so suspicious of those who save you?

Beldron: You did just lift a mountain from our heads, so... good enough for me, I reckon. || [context] NodeContext: Nodding, accepting - not going to look a gift horse in the mouth

Beldron: We were just slave-hands to the cult, but not Wulbren. He... knows things. Things they want to know too. || [context] NodeContext: Hesitant to say exactly what Wulbren knows
Barcus Wroot: What has he gotten himself mixed up in now...
Player: Before you ask, no - I'm not going to stage a rescue.
Beldron: Aye. Nor us, I'm afraid. || [context] NodeContext: shrugging, a little defeated. This line trails off into another 'Much as I want to march after Wulbren myself... we can't.'
Beldron: We have our own freedom to look to, I'm afraid. We'll take our chance when it arises, then back to the city. || [context] NodeContext: His people are still enslaved - he needs to be pragmatic.

If the player has the speak with animals skill, they get some additional insight into the cub's anxiety. If the player lets the cub live, it will proceed to eat its mother - it's still a wild animal, after all.

Narrator: *The cub looks from you to his dead mother.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The cub looks from dead mother to the player, wailing.NodeContext: Narrator node!
Owlbear Cub: *Braawww!*

----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: In SwA, the owlbear speaks like a human. Her voice is deep and threatening - the voice of a seasoned fighter, at home in a fight and used to winning. However, she knows she's injured and at a disadvantage, but refuses to betray that to the player. Doing so might encourage the player to attack, putting her cub in danger.The player stumbles upon the nest of an owlbear; a large, predatory hybrid creature. They find themselves in a stand-off against the beast - if they get too close or act aggressively, it attacks. If they keep cool and back off when the opportunity presents itself, the owlbear will let them leave. The player may also notice that the owlbear is wounded - a broken spear protrudes from one eye socket. They may notice that the owlbear has a cub - this is the main reason for her aggression and territoriality.Additional note 1: the player may stumble upon this scenario by themselves, or they may have been pointed in the right direction after meeting some cultists who had a close encounter with the owlbear. If we won these cultists over, they may be available to fight the owlbear at our side.Additional note 2: If the owlbear mother is killed but her cub survives, we can decide the juvenile's fate. If we spare it, we may later find it being used for sport by the goblins in their camp.

Narrator: *You feel the quake of its heavy footsteps before you see it: an owlbear, its beaked face looming out of the darkness.*
Owlbear: What's this? Something weak, something tender... || [context] NodeContext: Sizing up the player.
Owlbear: Won't even have to chew you before I feed you to my son, softmeat.
Player: You're injured - there's still half a spear lodged in your head.

Owlbear: The meat tastes better when it's afraid.
Player: Just allow me to leave. I'm no threat to you or your cub.
