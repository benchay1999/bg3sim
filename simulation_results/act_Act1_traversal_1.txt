Halsin: Speak to Rath - he will reward you for your efforts. || [context] NodeContext: Referring to one of his underlings
Player: What happens next?
Halsin: The journey to Moonrise Towers, and all the dangers that that entails.

Session Sequence: DenIntro -> AD_DenIntro -> AD -> PAD_ZevlorsMap
----- Session: DenIntro -----
Synopsis: In these dialogues, Zevlor reflects on what's happened (an attack of goblins at the gate, which the player helped with) and his mistrust of and bitterness towards the druids who are reluctantly hosting his people. He is exasperated, furious, but also eager to meet anyone who could help. He'll show a flash of anger and frustration at the start if the player struck him, but is pragmatic enough to calm himself once he realises you could be more help to him than harm.

Zevlor: Ngh. Mragreshem. || [context] InternalNodeContext: Remember he could have been KO by Aradin. The flag PostConfrontationDone will make him move after the dialogNodeContext: mrag-RESH-em. Means 'shithead' in infernal. Zevlor has just woken up after being punched in the face by Aradin. He's groggy and pissed off.
Zevlor: A cheap shot - to be expected from a drow. But you helped us, so instead of killing you, I'll just ask: || [context] NodeContext: Sneering, barely keeping his temper in check
Zevlor: Who in the Nine Hells do you think you are? || [context] NodeContext: absolutely seething
Player: Are you all right?
Zevlor: I'll survive a sore jaw. What I won't tolerate is a stranger waltzing in here and interfering in our business.
Zevlor: Lucky for you, you seem to have spooked that adventurer trash into leaving.
Zevlor: Whatever your business, I'd see to it quickly - the druids are forcing everyone out. || [context] NodeContext: Cautionary - his people are also being forced out
Zevlor: This attack will only strengthen their resolve. || [context] NodeContext: Grim, foreboding - and tired
Player: I won't be staying long - I just need to find a healer.
Zevlor: They've started a ritual to cut the grove off from the world outside.
Zevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters. || [context] NodeContext: Weary, doesn't know what to do
Player: This ritual - is there no way to convince the druids to stop it?
Zevlor: I've tried. Kagha - their new First Druid - won't even see me. || [context] NodeContext: Out of ideas
Zevlor: You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place. || [context] NodeContext: Slowly and thoughtfully - considering you, idea just occurring to him
Zevlor: Perhaps you could persuade her. For more time to prepare, if nothing else.
Player: I'll see what I can do. || [approval] ['Astarion -1', "Lae'zel -1", 'Gale 1', 'Wyll 5', 'Karlach 3']

----- Session: PAD_ZevlorsMap -----
Synopsis: |Player clicked on Zevlor's map (a map of Elturgard that shows the road to Baldur's Gate). Zevlor will likely have drawn on it.|

Player: Looks like we're in Elturgard. Some distance from the city of Baldur's Gate. || [context] NodeContext: Karlach, grumbling about being so far from BG
Player: Gnolls and goblins marked on the map. Travel won't be easy.

----- Session: PAD_Comment -----
Synopsis: This VB plays when players first see the results of a druid ritual: indestructible vines have enveloped the entire grove, sealing it off from the outside world. Players cannot get past them to the grove within.

======== Scenario: den_druidservant ========
Session Sequence: 005 -> 002 -> 003
----- Session: 005 -----
Synopsis: Arron is a friendly, but tired servant to the druids in the grove. Unless the player is a druid, he would rather they don't linger, though he is sympathetic and will help them any way he can (by selling them supplies). He is happy to see a druid and to help them. He can be a little preachy.

Arron: Another outsider? This place has certainly become popular. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Arron turns around and wipes his hands on his trousers (he was standing at a table, with his back to the player).
Arron: Well met, and thank you for beating back those goblins. Most brave of you.
Arron: Is there anything you need? Act fast if you do - the ritual will be complete before too long.
Player: What ritual are you talking about? || [context] InternalNodeContext: needs flag.
Arron: Ah - I forgot you're a blow-in. A few days hence, this grove will be completely concealed by thorny vines.
Arron: None will be able to enter - or leave.
Arron: A drastic measure. But more monsters seem to terrorise this region every day.
Player: What about the people here?
Arron: We druids will be safe. As for those that took refuge here... well, may Silvanus guard them as they continue their travels.
Player: Seems like most are tieflings. They'll be fine. They have devilish powers. || [approval] ['Astarion 1', 'Wyll -1', 'Karlach -1']
Arron: Ignorance is agony, my friend. I will include you in my prayers. I'd better get started - for your sake.

----- Session: 002 -----
Synopsis: A very condescending and somewhat objectionable druid servant. He believes the tiefling refugees hiding in the grove have brought chaos and would gladly be rid of them, even if turning them away would doom them.

Marcoryl: You may have won over Kagha, but I'm not so easily swayed.

----- Session: 003 -----
Synopsis: An elderly druid who would like nothing more than for the player to leave. Depending on what the player has done, he will be civil about it, but still incistent. If the child has died, he is openly hostile.

Loic: Shadow Druids... To think we were rotting from within. I'm sorry. I need a moment. || [context] InternalNodeContext: TODO: Add Shadow Druid Flag. Reaction for after the player exposed the Shadow druid plot. I don't know if he'll be part of the druids who fight alongside Sagha (I don't know if all pro-sagha druids do). But this works both if Sagha got convinced and if she's dead.NodeContext: They just discovered that their boss was being influenced by an evil organisation.

======== Scenario: den_volotravel ========
Session Sequence: AD -> 
----- Session: AD -----
Synopsis: Volo will have some casual behavior around camp. One of these behaviors is to wander over to a druid's tame bear and try to talk to it.

Volo: Ah, my grizzled friend! What can you tell me about this place? || [context] NodeContext: Approaching bear, looking for conversation
Bosk: *Grr...*
Volo: Yes, yes, I see. And is that 'grr' with two 'r's or one? || [context] NodeContext: Reacing to 'grr'. Volo is being dumb.

----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Volo is a canonical character in DnD. He's known for being the realm's go-to guy for compiling information. In this take, he fulfils that role but puts a twist on what he sees. He's keenly curious for facts but likes to embellish them. A bit like Gilderoy Lockheart. He IS talented, but his reputation has gotten away from him, too. In this dialogue, Volo will offer to put his knowledge at your service if you confide you've been infected with a mindflayer. He'll perform an icepick lobotomy that'll leave you without an eye or much in the way of apology from Volo. He should be clever, a little arrogant, very English, and very fun, without being a cartoon character.

Volo: Pardon me! Must prepare to travel - good day, my friend! || [context] NodeContext: Cheerfully done with you.
Player: Where are you heading?
Volo: ...I'll tell you, if you'd be so good as to answer a few questions pertaining to the goblins you encountered at the gates. || [context] NodeContext: Trying to entice the player.
Volo: A few questions, if you please. There's no overstating my interest. || [context] NodeContext: He wants to write down what you'll say. Enthusiastic.
Player: Fine - ask your questions.
Volo: Glory! Now, then: || [context] CinematicNodeContext: He's ready to write, quill to book.NodeContext: Player agreed to answer his questions. He's happy but also arrogant, like a rich old person saying 'you're an absolute DOLL' when you do a minor favor for them.
Volo: How would you describe that particular batch of goblins? Size? Nature? Distinguishing qualities? || [context] NodeContext: Quizzing the player, looking for info for his book. He's more professional here, curious.
: True
Narrator: *You search your mind, successfully recalling various details of goblin behaviour.*
Player: Common variety goblins, led by a lasher and flanked by booyahgs.
Volo: My! A scholar after my own heart. Spent much time among goblins?
Player: The time was spent among books. I'm a student of the page. || [approval] ['Gale 1']
Volo: Aha! I've always preferred experience to the second-hand accounts of lesser men. But to each their own!
Volo: Now I've a few more questions, if you don't mind.
Volo: And the... dragon they had marching in the rear. Was it of the brass or silver variety? || [context] NodeContext: Volo is bullshitting. There was no dragon and he knows it. But he's stating it to the player as though he believes it.
Player: I think there's been a misunderstanding. What do you want, exactly?
Volo: The truth, my friend! Not a jot more or less! || [context] NodeContext: Response to 'What are you getting at.' Volo doesn't really want the truth but he believes in his own morality.
Volo: Last question, then you'll be quite free. Did the attackers rally to 'the Absolute' when they fell upon the gates? || [context] NodeContext: He's wrapping things up, in full journalism mode.
Player: I don't think so. I was concentrating on not dying.
Volo: Really? Well, this does complicate things... but then again... well, never mind. || [context] NodeContext: Player says goblins didn't invoke 'the Absolute.' Volo is turning the idea around in his head, trying to figure it out. A man in thought.
Volo: I've interrogated one - a captive in this very camp. She reports they've abandoned their god Maglubiyet in favour of someone called 'the Absolute'.
Volo: The scandal! || [context] NodeContext: Hissed like he's just conveyed a very juicy bit of gossip
Player: What do you think Maglubiyet makes of this change?
Volo: Oh, I'd imagine him quite displeased. || [context] NodeContext: Like he's conveying a bit of juicy gossip.
Volo: Since their change in allegiance, these goblins are informed by a kind of strategy anathema to their kind. || [context] NodeContext: He finds this VERY interesting.

Synopsis: 

Player: I was a slave when we were last here. I do not appreciate being reminded of that.

======== Scenario: den_adventurerleader ========
Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Adventurer leader dialogue. Mostly used during Adventurers Quest. This is after the player has stopped Zevlor and Aradin from fighting one another. Aradin returns to his den to lick his wounds.

Aradin: If it ain't the fearless goblin-slayer. || [context] NodeContext: Aggressive, but not powerfully so. He's not a friendly guy.
Aradin: You sure you want to be seen with me? I ain't exactly popular with this lot. || [context] NodeContext: with a grimace - 'this lot' refers specifically to the tiefling refugees who are nearby but not necessarily in-shot, but he's grumpy enough that it also refers to just about everybody in the world
Player: All you did was stand up for your crew. I respect that.
Aradin: Half my crew are full of holes. || [context] NodeContext: annoyed, slightly sad
Aradin: Now I'm gonna take the blame for leading the goblins here, and losing track of the bloody druid. || [context] NodeContext: He knows these things are his fault, but he's sulking and petulant about it
Player: Who's the druid you lost track of?
Aradin: Halsin. He's the leader around these parts. Or was.
Aradin: We've got a contract to track down some relic, and he wanted in on the job. Eyes lit up when he heard about it.
Aradin: Didn't work out, though. Goblins got him when we were turning tail. He's either diggin' latrines or boilin' in a cookpot by now.
Player: Did you think getting rich would be easy?
Aradin: Dunno what I expected. That much gold for some long-lost relic. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])
Aradin: And from a wizard, too. I shoulda known. The gold probably turns to lead the moment you leave Baldur's Gate.
Aradin: Stupid thing to die for... || [context] NodeContext: Dismissive
Aradin: But gold ain't any use if you're too cold to spend it. || [context] NodeContext: Flippant
Player: Any idea what the relic actually is?
Aradin: If I knew that, I wouldn't be back here with half my crew gone. || [context] NodeContext: Bitter and sarcastic
Aradin: But look, if you're itching to meet Kelemvor, I won't stop you.
Aradin: It's called the Nightsong. Supposed to be hidden under the temple where the goblins jumped us.
Aradin: I'd give you the map and wish you a happy funeral, but my mate Brian kept hold of it like his own todger. Goblins made short of the fat old chunk. || [context] NodeContext: Disrespectful

Player: Who are you looking for?
Ormn: Master. He left with the weaponed two-legs. He said he'd be back.
Ormn: But I can smell them - the weaponed ones. And I cannot smell him... he's not coming back...
Player: Sounds like he's dead.
Ormn: No... it can't be! He wouldn't. Even... even with all the monsters... || [context] NodeContext: The player told him Halsin is probably dead.
Narrator: *The bear whines, lonely and afraid.*

----- Session: VB_Mirror -----

As they look around, they realise that the home's resident was in fact a wizard, laying low and conducting his own secret experiments while maintaining his cover as a doctor.

======== Scenario: for_owlbear ========
Session Sequence: LastCub ->  -> PAD_KilledByGoblins -> VB_EggPickedUp -> VB_CubResolution_1P -> VB_LastCub
----- Session: LastCub -----
Synopsis: In SwA, this cub speaks in short bursts - he sounds staccato, vicious.The player has killed an owlbear - a large, predatory wild animal. The owlbear's cub remains however, and lingers by his dead mother. The player can decide whether to put the cub out of its misery, or else leave it. If the player has the speak with animals skill, they get some additional insight into the cub's anxiety. If the player lets the cub live, it will proceed to eat its mother - it's still a wild animal, after all.

Narrator: *The cub looks from you to his dead mother.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The cub looks from dead mother to the player, wailing.NodeContext: Narrator node!
Owlbear Cub: *Braawww!*

----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: In SwA, the owlbear speaks like a human. Her voice is deep and threatening - the voice of a seasoned fighter, at home in a fight and used to winning. However, she knows she's injured and at a disadvantage, but refuses to betray that to the player. Doing so might encourage the player to attack, putting her cub in danger.The player stumbles upon the nest of an owlbear; a large, predatory hybrid creature. They find themselves in a stand-off against the beast - if they get too close or act aggressively, it attacks. If they keep cool and back off when the opportunity presents itself, the owlbear will let them leave. The player may also notice that the owlbear is wounded - a broken spear protrudes from one eye socket. They may notice that the owlbear has a cub - this is the main reason for her aggression and territoriality.Additional note 1: the player may stumble upon this scenario by themselves, or they may have been pointed in the right direction after meeting some cultists who had a close encounter with the owlbear. If we won these cultists over, they may be available to fight the owlbear at our side.Additional note 2: If the owlbear mother is killed but her cub survives, we can decide the juvenile's fate. If we spare it, we may later find it being used for sport by the goblins in their camp.

Narrator: *You feel the quake of its heavy footsteps before you see it: an owlbear, its beaked face looming out of the darkness.*
Owlbear: What's this? Something weak, something tender... || [context] NodeContext: Sizing up the player.
Owlbear: Won't even have to chew you before I feed you to my son, softmeat.
Player: You're injured - there's still half a spear lodged in your head.
Owlbear: It's a splinter. I've gutted bigger threats than you with worse. || [context] NodeContext: She has a spear sticking out of her eye.
Owlbear: The meat tastes better when it's afraid.
Player: Just allow me to leave. I'm no threat to you or your cub.
: False
Owlbear: You'll be even less of a threat when you're in pieces. || [approval] ["Lae'zel 1", 'Shadowheart -1', 'Karlach -1']

----- Session: PAD_KilledByGoblins -----

----- Session: VB_EggPickedUp -----
Synopsis: The player discovers an intact owlbear egg (think something the size of an ostrich egg) and makes an impressed remark. If there's an adult owlbear nearby, the player will remark that interferring with the egg will put them in danger.

Player: She'll tear me in two for touching her egg. || [context] NodeContext: Urgent. The player's taken an owlbear's unhatched egg while in combat with the owlbear mother (think a grizzly bear with a beak).

----- Session: VB_CubResolution_1P -----
Synopsis: The players comment briefly on their decision to let an orphaned owlbear cub live or not.

Player: Nature can provide for the cub. Perhaps it'll live. || [context] NodeContext: Reasoning decision to let an orphaned owlbear cub fend for itself.

----- Session: VB_LastCub -----
Synopsis: After killing an adult owlbear, combat ends as the player notes that the surviving owlbear cub doesn't pose much of a threat to them.

Synopsis: PAD when you pick up 'The Necromancy of Thay' (DangerousBook_Tome.lsj). Character might have a sense that the book is evil or just be curious about what it might contain.

Player: 'The Necromancy of Thay'? Sounds ominous.

----- Session: Tome -----
Synopsis: The player finds a book on necromancy - from one of the Red Wizards of Thay. Once read, the book will be bound to whoever tried to read it. Some origins will demand you let them read it, while others will want the book burned. If you read the book, you'll hear strange, distant whispers. The more you read, the stronger the voices will become, and the greater the chance that you'll be driven mad.

Narrator: *The book radiates power, but the words you read in the Codex echo in your mind, guiding your eyes safely across the page.*
Narrator: *The once-indecipherable glyphs now feel dangerously familiar, promising unholy power to those who can take it.*
Player: Read on and wrest the book's power from it.
: True
Narrator: *As you parse the strange glyphs, you can feel the book resisting. Ghostly voices whisper at you from the dark - probing and fighting your mind.*
Narrator: *But your will is iron and you brush past these shades of the past, devouring every secret the book has to offer.*
Narrator: *You see now, life and death are malleable as clay, to be bent and reshaped by your will. By your power.*
Narrator: *But as you close the book, a nagging doubt whispers in your mind. What consequences will there be for calling the dead from their rest?*

----- Session: PAD_PlayerTriedToTakeTome -----

----- Session: Flind -----
Synopsis: The flind is the leader of a pack of gnolls. Normally, these monsters hunger for flesh and eat anything, but the flind has been infected with a mind flayer's tadpole (like the players) and this has created an internal 'Voice' that guides it toward certain meat, forbidding others. The forbidden meats are those that work for the mind flayers - including the players - leading to a telepathic 'dialogue' when the flind restrains itself from attacking and calls off its pack.

We can attempt to overpower the Flind psionically, allowing us to control it temporarily in order to destroy the pack of gnolls. If we choose to fight the Flind, we should be prepared for a difficult encounter. It is strong, though far from the most powerful of its kind thanks to the war raging in its brain.

Narrator: *A diminutive creature sporting a red hat glares at you.*

Baaaaaaa. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The redcap doesn't know his illusion has failed - glaring in rage at the playerNodeContext: You don't know your illusion has failed - as far as you know, you're still a sheep. Consider making this 'sheep noise' beneath you - animalistic and rage filled as you hiss out a 'Baaa'
Narrator: *That noise. Is the creature pretending to be a... sheep?*
Player: Leave.

======== Scenario: hag_hagspawn ========
Session Sequence: ResurrectHusband -> PAD_FireplaceIllusion -> SurrogateMother_AD_HagOccupied -> AD_HagSurrogateMotherStartScene -> Husband -> AD_HusbandGrave -> PAD_AfterResurrection
----- Session: ResurrectHusband -----
Synopsis: The player has discovered a wand that will allow them to raise Mayrina's husband from the dead. Mayrina is standing by the coffin that holds her dead husband. When player raises Connor from the dead, the coffin door bursts open and he crawls out of it a zombie - unable to speak in anything other than moans and groans. Player can take the zombie as a summon, kill the zombie, or give the zombie to Mayrina.

Mayrina: Gods, didn't hear you coming. I know I should head home, but I can't bring myself to leave. || [context] NodeContext: look up from quietly crying, surprised
Mayrina: The thought of putting him in a wheelbarrow and making the journey all over again... *Sigh.* || [context] NodeContext: turns back to the grave, arms crossed - then gestures to the coffin. Trying not to cry.
Player: Stand with her in silence.
Mayrina: We were just kids when we met. Heh. I might have pushed him off a swing I wanted. || [context] NodeContext: Smile and love in your voice as you talk about your husband
Mayrina: He got right up and pushed me back. I was so surprised that I just laughed. He did too.
Mayrina: We've barely spent a day apart since.

----- Session: PAD_FireplaceIllusion -----
Synopsis: This triggers near the fireplace in the hag's home. If you see through the illusion, you realise that there is a passage way behind it. Otherwise you just see a pleasant fire.

Player: Fireplace isn't real. What's hidden behind it?

----- Session: SurrogateMother_AD_HagOccupied -----
Synopsis: This is an edgecase in which the player talks to Mayrina when the hag isn't present. Mayrina is afraid, looking around for the hag - doesn't want to get into trouble. Sitting down in her chair.

Mayrina: Quick. Get out of here. She won't like me talking to you. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Sitting down in her chair - looking at her foodNodeContext: Afraid - looking around for the hag. Head low.

----- Session: AD_HagSurrogateMotherStartScene -----
Synopsis: This fires between Mayrina and the Hag in the teahouse before the player has spoken to either of them.

Mayrina: You've a face on you that could turn milk, petal. || [context] NodeContext: Sing song voice - cheery.
Mayrina: A walk would cheer me up. || [context] NodeContext: You ask this tentatively. You're desperate to go outside but don't want to upset Ethel.
: Hush, now! Won't be discussing that again. || [context] NodeContext: Smile as you dismiss the girl's request to leave. Cheery.

----- Session: Husband -----
Synopsis: Mayrina's husband has been resurrected - but he's not the man she married. He's a horrible and decomposing zombie.

Connor Vinderblad: Raa? || [context] NodeContext: Guttural and disturbing. You're a zombie that has a decomposing jaw.

----- Session: AD_HusbandGrave -----
Synopsis: This occurs above the grave of Connor, Mayrina's husband. It was written by the hag and is a cruel jab.

Player: 'Here lies Connor - beloved husband, and a tasty little morsel to boot.' || [context] NodeContext: Above a gravestone - a cruel jab.

----- Session: PAD_AfterResurrection -----
Synopsis: The player's found a wand in the Hag's lair and tried to use it to resurrect Mayrina's husband. Unfortunately, it was cursed and he only came back a zombie. The players reflect on using items from evil beings.

Player: Not quite the outcome intended, but I must say - the technique was excellent.
Player: The spell is cast - what's done is done.

======== Scenario: hag_gurhunter ========
Session Sequence: Dead -> 
----- Session: Dead -----
Synopsis: We can speak to Gandrel if he dies - he'll hint at his mission to hunt Astarion on behalf of Maiden Fel. Separate options if it's Astarion himself speaking to him.

Narrator: *The corpse regards you lifelessly.*
Player: What brought you to this place?
Gandrel: Wise... woman... questions...

----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Male, middle-age or older.Gandrel is a monster hunter we encounter outside the Hag's lair. He's pleasant, cheerful, and a little eccentric - but shows his experience and expertise when warning us about the hag. He's affable and unassuming, but shows moments of steel when discussing his quarry (Astarion). A younger General Iroh from Avatar is a good reference - someone who makes you feel good about yourself just by conversing with you.

Gandrel: Ah, a fellow wanderer. Forgive the aroma. || [context] NodeContext: Friendly - noticing a stranger, wryly apologising for the slight stench
Narrator: *You catch a waft of something foul - metallic and sickly-sweet.*
Gandrel: Powdered iron-vine. Most monsters will think twice before making a meal of me. || [context] NodeContext: Explaining the smell in the air - he's taken a foul substance designed to ward off monsters
Gandrel: An old hunter's trick - if you can't mask your scent, spoil it. || [context] NodeContext: Friendly, unassuming, as if what he's saying is perfectly conventional
Player: You're a monster hunter? Not what I imagined.
Gandrel: Hah. Perhaps that is why I have survived so long where more fearsome peers have not. || [context] NodeContext: Serene, absolutely unoffended by us basically saying he doesn't look too tough
Gandrel: You would be wise to look past the seeming of things, if you intend to bargain with the lady of this house.
Gandrel: A sharp wit will serve you better, if you're to bargain with the lady of this house.
Gandrel: That is why you come to her lair, I take it? To bargain? || [context] NodeContext: Gently prodding for our story
Player: Why would you assume that?
Gandrel: Because this is her domain. If you are here, it is because it suits her. || [context] NodeContext: Stating the facts as they are - the hag dwarfs his power, and he accepts that and walks in anyway
Gandrel: Her kind have hidden among us since the first darkness - and their knowledge is matched only by their spite. || [context] NodeContext: Growing slightly grave - telling us of a great evil thing that is not to be underestimated
Gandrel: Know how to ask, and they'll share that knowledge. If you're fool enough to pay their price. || [context] NodeContext: Telling us the risk might be worth the reward - but is is a great risk
Player: What price is that?
Gandrel: Whatever's easiest to lose and hardest to do without.
Gandrel: But the thing I hunt has gone to ground. If she can tell me how to draw him out, I'll pay whatever she asks.
Gandrel: But she thrives on suffering. Once she hears what awaits my quarry when I catch him, she will help. || [context] NodeContext: Growing grave
Player: Any advice on how to deal with her?
Gandrel: Scream. Turn. Run the other way - that's what I'd like to say.
Gandrel: But bad as she is, I'm betting whatever drove you to her door is worse.
Gandrel: So instead: know you're outmatched. Know what you're willing to give. And mind your manners.

======== Scenario: hag_hag ========
Session Sequence: PAD_TriedTart -> Transformed
----- Session: PAD_TriedTart -----
Synopsis: Player eats a disguised Hag Tart, not knowing it's truly rotten and noxious. Brave (or foolish) players can eat the tart a second time, deepening their misery.

Player: Gods spare me, why did I think eating a second one was a good idea?

----- Session: Transformed -----
Synopsis: The Hag is about to perform her eye-extraction and replanting on you. She is in her hag form in all its disgusting glory. Initially she's happy and feeling powerful -- but when she finds out your tadpole is Netherese, she becomes angry; not quite frightened, but anxious about having that magic in her home. She wants you out and has no more patience for you.

: Much better. That human skin is fierce restrictive. || [context] NodeContext: You've just transformed into a towering monstrous hag. You are LOVING IT. Give your shoulders a luxurious stretch as you settle into your true form. You can't wait for the player's reaction. Like a cat purring as they stretch out,
Player: So the brothers were right. You are a hag.
: Indeed I am. And a fabulous one at that. || [context] NodeContext: Grinning and flirtatious but in a very  very creepy way
: Not many get to see a hag in all her glory. Consider yourself blessed. || [context] NodeContext: You are like a QUEEN, gesturing to yourself dramatically - loving the DRAMA of it all
: Now choose. Which eye will it be? Right or left? || [context] NodeContext: The big moment - pausing for dramatic effect, holds up hand for right/left
Player: Attack.
: You absolute eejit.

======== Scenario: hag_well ========
Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: This well sits just outside of the hag's teahouse. When the player drinks from it, they feel a rush of power and gain a positive status (regardless of whether the illusion is up or down). However, once they enter combat with the hag, it turns to poison in their veins.

Narrator: *A fetid smell assaults your nostrils. Dead flesh lies below - a great deal of it.* || [context] NodeContext: The well is disgusting and well
Narrator: *Fresh, sweet-smelling water gurgles gently below.* || [context] NodeContext: Soft and idyllic description of the well
Player: Drink from the well.

--- Scenario Details ---
======== Scenario: hag_gurhunter ========
Session Sequence: PAD_BetrayedAstarion
----- Session: PAD_BetrayedAstarion -----
Synopsis: PAD that plays if you decide to tell the Gur Hunter in the Swamp where to find Astarion (HAG_GurHunter.lsj).  You tell the Hunter where your camp is, the Hunter says he'll take Astarion during the night the next time you go to sleep, then the dialog ends and this PAD plays.Your companion reacts to your decision to hand Astarion over (speaker 2) and then you clarify/justify your decision (speaker 1)

Player: You gave him up? I wasn't sure you would.
Player: He's too dangerous to have around. We'd always be sleeping with one eye open.

======== Scenario: hag_hag ========
Session Sequence: PAD_TadpoleDivine
----- Session: PAD_TadpoleDivine -----
Synopsis: This VB plays after attempting to get Ethel to remove the tadpole. She confesses that there's something special about it and she can't remove it.Will play on the player who leaves the dialog that reveals this fact, but characters can be fairly opinionated here since they are reacting to knowledge.Up to two characters.

Player: The tadpole was tampered with? That complicates things...
Player: Tampered or not, we need to get these things out of our heads. Let's find another way.

======== Scenario: hag_hagambush ========
Session Sequence: PAD_SidedHag
----- Session: PAD_SidedHag -----
Synopsis: This VB plays after saving Ethel from the two brothers of the sister she's holding captive. Ether disappeared in a magic puff, and she was acting suspicious. The players are reacting to her exit and discussing that there may be more to Ethel than meets the eye.Speaker 1 may have been the character who was in dialog for the scene with Ethel. Speaker 2 is another party member. However, since there may be combat, this setup isn't guaranteed and it's best to write this assuming everyone had a hand in the actions that led to this VB playing.

Player: Bloody way to end an argument. I hope we chose the right side.
Player: No point in debating what's already done. Let's go on ahead.

----- Session: DwarvenAlchemist -----
Synopsis: Derryth is a dwarven alchemist visiting the underdark from Baldur's Gate. She runs a shop in the city with Baelen, her business partner. They've come to the underdark in search of a very valuable mushroom - noblestalk. When the player arrived, she was tending to an injured gnome.
Derryth is a bit gruff - she's a healer, but her bedside manner leaves a lot to be desired. She's also a very shrewd businessperson. She's in the underdark to get rich first and foremost.
She treats her business partner (Baelen) like he's an idiot, and pretends not to care about him, but in reality he is the most important person to her in the world.

Derryth Bonecloak: You don't know what you've done. Leave me be. || [context] NodeContext: Player cured Baelen. She's facing a terrible future.
Player: I know exactly what I've done. Very entertaining. || [approval] ['Wyll -1', 'Karlach -1']
Derryth Bonecloak: You're a beast - you and Baelen  would make fine bedfellows.
Derryth Bonecloak: Get out of my face. Find some else's suffering to lap up.

----- Session: AD_CheckpointGuard_002_Combat -----
Synopsis: One-shot combat AD to play when the myconid is taking their turn.

Restless Myconid: ((*the disease still festers. I will cut it out*))

----- Session: CheckpointGuard_001 -----
Synopsis: Individual myconid responds with one-liner after you have gained access to the myconid circle. Hallucinogenic delivery.

Narrator: *The creature's song rumbles within you, neither warm nor welcoming.*

----- Session: VB_GlutDead_1P -----
Synopsis: Players refuse to kill Sovereign Spawn on Sovereign Glut's behalf. Glut has attacked the players and is now dead. The party comments afterwards.

Player: The usurper is dead. So much for 'Circle Glut'.

----- Session: CheckpointGuard_000 -----
Synopsis: You come upon the myconid guards. They warn the sovereign of your presence telepathically, and it begins to speak to you. This should be creepy, hallucinatory.

Narrator: *You are swallowed by a chorus of turbulent music. Through one creature sing many voices: the harmony of an entire collective.*
Restless Myconid: ((*Sovereign. they have come. they are here*))
Narrator: *The choir fades. A single melody rises above the others, brassy and commanding.*
: ((*I am Sovereign*))
Narrator: *You see a vision: your lifeless body, wrapped in fungal tendrils. The sovereign is threatening you.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Player closes eyes as if seeing the vision in their head.
: ((*state your purpose*))
Player: I am a traveller seeking adventure. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Player closes eyes.
: True
Narrator: *Fungal roots weave through your mind, seeking your true intent.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Player closes eyes as if to see the vision. || [approval] ['Gale 1', 'Shadowheart 1', 'Wyll 1', 'Karlach 1']
Narrator: *Then the sovereign drones a new melody, cautious but welcoming.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Overhead view, as sovereign is not in sight range.
: ((*descend to me. let us speak in flesh*)) || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Overhead view, as sovereign is not in sight range. (Custom cameras required)
Narrator: *The persistent music coaxes you forward. The sovereign expects you.*

----- Session: DeepRothe -----
Synopsis: A Deep Rothe that belongs to Derryth and Baelen Bonecloak. A beast of burden with a simple Speak with Animals dialogue. There's some reactivity depending on whether Baelen has returned to the bonecloak camp or not, and if Baelen recovered his senses by eating the noblestalk mushroom. The animal's observations reinforce that Baelen has been more amiable and gentle since his mind began to slip, and his recovery is not seen as a good thing by all.

Deep Rothé: Master sounds different, like old self. Angry self. Don't like. || [context] NodeContext: SWA line. Reproachful. A simple beast of burden senses his master has returned to a crueler demeanour.

----- Session: AD_CheckpointGuard_004_Combat -----
Synopsis: One-shot combat AD to play when the myconid is taking their turn.

Noxious Myconid: ((*you will fall. and in death, we will raise you*))

----- Session: SocietyOfBrilliance_Scholar -----
Synopsis: The player meets Blurg, a hobgoblin (deep orc) member of the Society of Brilliance, a group of intelligent, neutral monsters working to improve the Underdark. He talks about his research and, if the tadpole is mentioned, brings his mind flayer friend Omeluum to talk to the player. The player can either agree to the mind flayer's help or attack.

Blurg: I must complete this study. Entertain yourself elsewhere.

----- Session: AD_Myconid_004_Combat -----
Synopsis: One-shot combat AD to play when the myconid is taking their turn.

Noxious Myconid: ((*defend the circle. stop the decay*))

----- Session: AD_Myconid_003_Combat -----
Synopsis: One-shot combat AD to play when the myconid is taking their turn.

Restless Myconid: ((*intruder. interloper. invader*))

----- Session: ServantHookHorror_01 -----
Synopsis: You interact with a hook horror servant belonging to the myconids.

Narrator: *The monstrosity stares blankly forward.*

----- Session: BroodingSovereign -----
Synopsis: A sovereign myconid we call the brooding sovereign has been displaced to this myconid circle, after the duergar attackes his home. He would like to join you as you cleanse the area of duergar as a means of getting revenge - supposedly.

 The top block: The borroding myconid is with the other myconids. You can recruit it.

The middle block: You have killed the lone duergar. the myconid now wants you to kill all the duergars.

 Next block: you have killed all the duergars; now it wants you to kill the sovereign
. 
Final block: you have killed the sovereign and it rewards you. 

This myconid does not speak with the same hive mind voice of the others. He should sound creepy, like FART in Rick and Morty, with a SLIGHT undercurrent of menace.

 As the quest moves on, he gets more and more creepy and angry,

Sovereign Glut: ((*the tumour is excised. the duergar are dead*))
Sovereign Glut: ((*here, I break ground. from the dark will a mighty Circle rise. my song will fill the Grotto!*))
Sovereign Glut: ((*death-doer - the Grotto may sustain but one Sovereign. in the Age of Glut...*))
Sovereign Glut: ((*...there may be no Spaw. eliminate the other Sovereign*))
Player: Why not. Spaw's time is done. || [approval] ['Astarion 1', 'Wyll -1']
Sovereign Glut: ((*come, then. bring me to Spaw and I will sing its doom*))
Sovereign Glut: ((*the Age of Glut begins*))

----- Session: CheckpointGuard_004 -----
Synopsis: Individual myconid responds with one-liner after you have gained access to the myconid circle. Hallucinogenic delivery.

Noxious Myconid: ((*no peace*))

----- Session: ServantDuergar1 -----
Synopsis: Player tries speaking with an enthralled duergar. Duergar players get an option to go hostile afterwards.

Player: It would seem not.
Beldron: You did just lift a mountain from our heads, so... good enough for me, I reckon. || [context] NodeContext: Nodding, accepting - not going to look a gift horse in the mouth
Beldron: Here - the Ironhand Gnomes honour their debts. With Wulbren gone, that falls to me. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Standard 'handing reward' animation.NodeContext: Drawing himself up to perform a necessary obligation - doesn't see himself as leadership material but accepts the responsibility

Player: Before you ask, no - I'm not going to stage a rescue.
Beldron: Aye. Nor us, I'm afraid. || [context] NodeContext: shrugging, a little defeated. This line trails off into another 'Much as I want to march after Wulbren myself... we can't.'
Beldron: We have our own freedom to look to, I'm afraid. We'll take our chance when it arises, then back to the city. || [context] NodeContext: His people are still enslaved - he needs to be pragmatic.

They're overzealous and easily duped, and are currently worshipping a murderous redcap they've mistaken for a god of murder. He's capitalising on the situation and very much enjoying the incredible power with which he's been invested. In this dialogue, we can deal with him as this great inscrutable power, or see through the situation and expose / do a deal with him. In all cases he's brash, offensive and generally gross.The all cap lines are BOOOAL in his fully powerful form.When we suddenly rever to lower caps, it's when we've forced him into his 'common' form.BOOOAL = Boo-AHHL (almost guttural)Kuo-Toa = Koo-oh-TO-ah

BOOOAL: ARGH! NO! SHUT IT! Shut your rotten mouth! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: BOOOAL is in the process of reverting back into his common form. He is invisible for the capitalised parts of this now, but then becomes visible for "Shut your rotten mouth"NodeContext: The lack of faith is literally draining power from him - sulky and furious all in one as he returns to his common form

BOOOAL: Shut it, you!  I'm talking to... my Chosen! Chosen got power - you want power, don't ya? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: BOOOAL is in his common form. He is no longer invisible, and just appears as an ordinary redcapNodeContext: Shouting his high priest down - he wants to seal the deal with us before his idiot followers fully catch on

Player: The druid Halsin is in here somewhere.
Player: Let's hope we find him in one piece.
