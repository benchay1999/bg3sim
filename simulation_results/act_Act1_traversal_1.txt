----- Session: AD_BirdSender -----
Synopsis: |Druid sending a bird to find Halsin. |

Apikusis: Dark times. And getting darker.

----- Session: AD_Ritual -----
Synopsis: Five druids participate in a ritual around a sacred pool. The chant will summon a coccoon of thorns that will encircle their entire grove. Lines play sequentially, each druid saying one line, then the next, etc.They're chanting at a normal to low volume. They're attempting to suss power out from the earth itself, but they're not forcing it out. There should be a loose rhythm to it (think Arwen from LoTR when she summons the river horses), but it shouldn't come across like a drum circle.

Aelar, Karrik, Inwe, Tahan, Elwyn: Ab spiritu humoque, aculeus vitisque. || [context] NodeContext: Chanting a magic spell: Ahb SPEE-ree-too oo-MOHK, AH-coo-lay-oos VEE-tees-kway.

Apikusis: Tell me what you find. Tell only me. Understand?
Tingmiaq: *Chirp!* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Hopping from foot NodeContext: Cheerful, excited.
Apikusis: Fly quick. Fly safe.

----- Session: RitualDruid2 -----
Synopsis: This dialogue can occur in three different states: In the first, Kerrick is in a trance, chanting a spell that will cover the druid grove in thorns. In the second, the ritual has been stopped after a druid named Kagha was exposed as a Shadow Druid. Kerrick is furious - he feels betrayed by Kagha, and doesn't quite care if she's been killed.In the third, a group of goblins that had threatened the grove has been dealt with and the grove is considered safe again. In this state, Kerrick has calmed down a good bit - now that the danger's passed, he's seeing things with a bit more clarity. The player always encounters Kerrick around a sacred druid pool.

Karrik: We wasted so much time fighting each other. || [context] NodeContext: The danger has passed, but there was much infighting in the druid grove, which he believes put them at higher risk.
Karrik: Silvanus taught us a lesson by letting an outsider save us. || [context] NodeContext: Players are the outsider here - they saved the druid grove from both infighting and a goblin attack.

----- Session: RitualDruid5 -----
Synopsis: This dialogue can occur in three different states: In the first, Tahani is in a trance, chanting a spell that will cover the druid grove in thorns. In the second, the ritual has been stopped after a druid named Kagha was exposed as a Shadow Druid. Tahani is furious that players stopped the ritual - even though Kagha had ulterior motives, Tahani still believes her path was best and that players had no right to intervene.In the third, a group of goblins that had threatened the grove has been dealt with and the grove is considered safe again. In this state, Tahani isn't convinced the threat is really over. She thinks her fellow druids will lead them down the same path again, taking pity on people that will only bring trouble to their door.The player always encounters Inwe around a sacred druid pool. She's more or less the xenophobic conservative of the chanting druids.

Tahan: You think you saved us? You just prolonged the inevitable. || [context] NodeContext: The ritual has stopped and the goblin threat against the grove is dealt with, but she believes something similar will happen again so long as her fellow druids let outsiders in.
Tahan: Sooner or later, other outsiders will bring trouble to the grove. || [context] NodeContext: The ritual has stopped and the goblin threat against the grove is dealt with, but she believes something similar will happen again so long as her fellow druids let outsiders in.

----- Session: AD_RitualDruid2 -----
Synopsis: This AD has two phases: the first plays if a druid ritual Kerrick was part of was stopped because their leader was exposed as a shadow druid. In this state, Kerrick feels angry and betrayed - he thought he was part of something good when really he was being used.The second state plays once the goblins that threatened the grove - and necessitated the ritual - have been dealt with. In this state, Kerrick is reflective and calm. The threat is gone, but there's much to be learned from it.

Karrik: How could we be so blind? || [context] NodeContext: The ritual has been stopped, but the goblin threat remains. Karrik feel betrayed by Kagha.

----- Session: RitualDruid1 -----
Synopsis: This dialogue can occur in three different states: In the first, Aelar is in a trance, chanting a spell that will cover the druid grove in thorns. In the second, the ritual has been stopped after a druid named Kagha was exposed as a Shadow Druid. Aelar is in a daze - several days of chanting have left him a bit loopy.In the third, a group of goblins that had threatened the grove has been dealt with and the grove is considered safe again. In this state, Aelar is still exhausted, but he's gathered his senses, more or less. The player always encounters Aelar around a sacred druid pool.

Aelar: Aggeniculamur in umbra... did I say that out loud? || [context] NodeContext: Dazed. He's been chanting for days. Pronounced: AH-jeh-nee-koo-lah-moor een OOM-brah
Aelar: We've been chanting for days. I need some rest.

----- Session: BirdSender -----
Synopsis: This dialogue can take place in two different states. In the first, Apakusis is short and defensive. The grove's ranking leader, Kagha, has gathered support to close off the grove to outsiders with an intense ritual. She doesn't trust Kagha, and quietly despairs to see her grove turn to such measures.In the second state, the ritual has been stopped. She's shocked at the revelation that Kagha had been involved with Shadow Druids, and is having trouble accepting it.The player finds this druid speaking to a bird in the druid grove.

Apikusis: Again?
Apikusis: Speak.
Player: What were you saying to that bird?
Apikusis: The bird knows. She needs to know. You do not.
Player: I helped defend this grove - I'm not your enemy.
: False
Apikusis: Not all enemies are outside our walls.

Olodan the shadow druid is their leader; slobbering and sleazy.

Player: That snake must be held accountable.
Rath: By every star, by every vein on every leaf, she must.
Rath: This has only happened because our true leader was taken from us.
Player: Kagha seems happy to rule the roost. Who's your real leader?
Rath: Master Halsin. Perhaps goblin-caught, perhaps dead. He'd set... Mistress Kagha back in line. Hold her to task. Stop this damned ritual. || [context] NodeContext: 'Mistress' is sarcastic here.
Rath: More will die if the rite is finished. So many more, sent into a world gone mad...
Player: I'm in need of a healer. Badly.

Kagha: Who better to understand a watchful broodmother than a beloved child of Lolth?
Player: I'd have killed the thief outright. || [approval] ['Astarion 1', 'Wyll -5', 'Karlach -5']
Kagha: Yes. Yes. This could be the true way of Silvanus.

Player: What about the people here?
Arron: We druids will be safe. As for those that took refuge here... well, may Silvanus guard them as they continue their travels.
Player: Seems like most are tieflings. They'll be fine. They have devilish powers. || [approval] ['Astarion 1', 'Wyll -1', 'Karlach -1']

Zevlor: Who in the Nine Hells do you think you are? || [context] NodeContext: absolutely seething

======== Scenario: den_volotravel ========
Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Volo is a canonical character in DnD. He's known for being the realm's go-to guy for compiling information. In this take, he fulfils that role but puts a twist on what he sees. He's keenly curious for facts but likes to embellish them. A bit like Gilderoy Lockheart. He IS talented, but his reputation has gotten away from him, too. In this dialogue, Volo will offer to put his knowledge at your service if you confide you've been infected with a mindflayer. He'll perform an icepick lobotomy that'll leave you without an eye or much in the way of apology from Volo. He should be clever, a little arrogant, very English, and very fun, without being a cartoon character.

Volo: Ah, my good friend! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: He's holding a book and a quill, scribbling notations when he notices you.NodeContext: He's holding a book and a quill, scribbling notations when he notices you. He's happy to see you, he has questions for you!
Volo: Forgive my surprise. It's rare to find your kind above ground. Rare and intriguing on a day already packed with intrigue! || [context] NodeContext: polite and enthusiastic
Volo: You were at the gates just now, no? When the goblins came? You saw them up close? || [context] NodeContext: He's about to start quizzing you on what you saw. Eager.
Volo: A few questions, if you please. There's no overstating my interest. || [context] NodeContext: He wants to write down what you'll say. Enthusiastic.
Player: Fine - ask your questions.
Volo: Glory! Now, then: || [context] CinematicNodeContext: He's ready to write, quill to book.NodeContext: Player agreed to answer his questions. He's happy but also arrogant, like a rich old person saying 'you're an absolute DOLL' when you do a minor favor for them.
Volo: How would you describe that particular batch of goblins? Size? Nature? Distinguishing qualities? || [context] NodeContext: Quizzing the player, looking for info for his book. He's more professional here, curious.
: True
Narrator: *You search your mind, successfully recalling various details of goblin behaviour.*
Player: Common variety goblins, led by a lasher and flanked by booyahgs.
Volo: My! A scholar after my own heart. Spent much time among goblins?
Player: The time was spent among books. I'm a student of the page. || [approval] ['Gale 1']
Volo: Aha! I've always preferred experience to the second-hand accounts of lesser men. But to each their own!
Volo: Now I've a few more questions, if you don't mind.
Volo: And the... dragon they had marching in the rear. Was it of the brass or silver variety? || [context] NodeContext: Volo is bullshitting. There was no dragon and he knows it. But he's stating it to the player as though he believes it.
Player: Heh - it was brass. No doubt about it.
Volo: 'Witness... mistook... obvious... silver... dragon... for... brass...' || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Scribbling in notebookNodeContext: Response to 'I said it was a brass dragon.' Volo is bullshitting.
Volo: Last question, then you'll be quite free. Did the attackers rally to 'the Absolute' when they fell upon the gates? || [context] NodeContext: He's wrapping things up, in full journalism mode.
Player: I don't think so. I was concentrating on not dying.
Volo: Really? Well, this does complicate things... but then again... well, never mind. || [context] NodeContext: Player says goblins didn't invoke 'the Absolute.' Volo is turning the idea around in his head, trying to figure it out. A man in thought.
Volo: I've interrogated one - a captive in this very camp. She reports they've abandoned their god Maglubiyet in favour of someone called 'the Absolute'.
Volo: The scandal! || [context] NodeContext: Hissed like he's just conveyed a very juicy bit of gossip
Player: Hold your tongue.
Volo: Never you mind. I'm on my way to their camp as we speak. I always knew my studies in Ghukliak would come to some use.

Nadira: But you're not here for heroics, are you? Avernus' stench is all over your skin.
Nadira: Let me guess: your devil mistress sent you to get her soul coin back. Too bad. I earned it fair and square.
Karlach: Oh man, a soul coin? Wouldn't mind getting my hands on that... || [context] NodeContext: Very interested but maybe downplaying her interest.
Player: That bugbear would have crushed your skull. This is the thanks I get?
Nadira: Why thank you, dread slayer of bugbears. You shall live forever in my memory. || [context] NodeContext: Dramatically exaggerated/sarcastic.
Nadira: Now take my regards back to that pouting erinyes and leave me alone. || [context] NodeContext: Very flat, almost cold.
Player: How about this? You give me the coin. Now.
Player: You hand the coin over, or I kill you. How about that?
: True
Nadira: Considering you turned that bugbear into paste... || [approval] ['Shadowheart 1', 'Karlach 1']

Asharak: Because you know who you are, now - what you can do.
Asharak: I'll leave the worrying to whatever god or mortal is dumb enough to stand in your way.
Asharak: You. I don't have the words or the means to thank you for what you did here.
Asharak: But it won't be for want of trying - know that you have kin in Baldur's Gate.
Asharak: Gods, I'm inclined to carry you there myself - but I know you've unfinished business out here.
Asharak: If you're inclined, we'll join you at your camp. I mean to drink you under the table.
Asharak: Gather your people and I'll gather mine. We can leave together, when you're ready.

Nettie: Not now. I'm busy. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Hand raised in a sign to wait and then turns back to what she was doing .NodeContext: Terse, impatient. She's dealing with serious matters right now.

----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Nettie is the apprentice of Halsin, the missing druid. We can tell her about the parasite in our heads. She listens with compassion but decides the player is too dangerous and must be quarantined. If she knows about the parasite, she'll invite the player to come with her deeper into her rooms for "treatement."

Nettie: First you save us from goblins, then you bring Kagha back from the brink. You're making your mark. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Examining injured bird. Glances up from her work to look at player.NodeContext: Examining injured bird. Glances up from her work to look at player.

----- Session: AD -----
Synopsis: This triggers as Nettie is at her desk in Halsin's lab, researching and organising. The bird she was treating may have died at this point.

Nettie: Halsin would have known what to do. Damn it all.

----- Session: Bird -----
Synopsis: This bird has been told to go and find Halsin and you're interupting him just as he's getting ready to take flight. He's tense and in a hurry to be gone, so he'll only answer one question before taking to the skies and carrying out his mission.

Tingmiaq: Not now. Places to be.
Player: Where are you going?
Tingmiaq: To find Halsin. There's not a moment to lose!

----- Session: AD_TadpoledStart -----

----- Session: PAD_SeeDrow -----
Synopsis: The player broke inside the room without Nettie. Normally they follow her inside and they get the info from her. The VB stops playing when the tadpoled scene with Nettie starts or when Halsin is found in the goblin camp.

Player: I wonder what happened to that drow.
Player: Is there a dead tadpole in that jar?
Player: And look at that statue.
Player: I can't tell if this is a temple or a library.

Synopsis: The player triggered combat during the tadpoled scene

Nettie: I don't want to hurt you - but I have to protect the others.

----- Session: AD_WithBird -----

----- Session: WoundedBird -----
Synopsis: Wounded bird is resting on the table after being treated by Nettie. It's probably going to die. If you poke it repeatedly, it will die.

Wounded Bird: Please... I'm resting...
Player: Something took a chunk out of you. What happened?
Narrator: *The bird says nothing, trying to rest.*
Wounded Bird: Please... I'm resting...
Player: Something took a chunk out of you. What happened?
Narrator: *The bird says nothing, trying to rest.*
Wounded Bird: Please... I'm resting...

Wounded Bird: Argh! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Player prods the bird's injured wing
Wounded Bird: Big dog - gnoll... I got too close...
Player: Where did you see these gnolls?
Wounded Bird: Hills... near road...
Narrator: *The bird lapses into silence, her head lolling to the side.*
Player: Prod her again. || [approval] ['Astarion 1', 'Gale -1', 'Wyll -1', 'Karlach -1']
Narrator: *She lies limply on the table, completely still.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Player prods the bird. No response.

----- Session: PAD_LockedUp -----
Synopsis: This is the VB that plays after Nettie locks the players up in her study once the players refuse to take the poison. She doesn't fight them, but the party reflects on her actions as a result of confessing the existence of the tadpoles.Speaker 1 is the player who disclosed the information and may show regret or indifference towards the current state.Speaker 2 comments on speaker 1 telling the truth to Nettie.

Player: So much for honesty. Our healer turned into a jailor pretty quickly once she heard about the tadpole.
Player: Can't blame anyone for reacting with fear - but it might do to keep our condition on a need-to-know basis.

----- Session: PAD_Dying -----
Synopsis: The player has the status DEN_APPRENTICE_THORN on them. This status has 3 stages leading to death. This PAD plays after a long rest: the player let the status get worse and worse. Right after this PAD, the player dies. These are their last words.

Player: Argh, the poison. It's too much. It's too late... || [context] NodeContext: You're dying, poison has overtaken your system. These are your last words.

----- Session: HealedBird -----
Synopsis: The 'Wounded Bird' that Nettie was treating after some time has passed (after Goblin Hunt or Attack on Den). The bird's recovering and feels a bit better.

Wounded Bird: There was so much noise out there. I'm glad you're okay.

----- Session: PAD_TadpoleResearch -----
Synopsis: Player read Halsin's research on the mind flayer tadpole. The VB plays only if they didn't find Halsin already and didn't go through the tadpoled scene with Nettie (otherwise they got all that information from her so it's not a surprise).

Player: Looks like Halsin's our best bet for a cure.
Player: We need to find him, before it's too late.
Player: What if something happened to him?
Player: All the more reason to hurry.

----- Session: AD_Studying -----
Synopsis: After poisoning the tadpoled player, Nettie settles down at her old Master's desk to see if she can uncover any secrets about the tadpole in his research.

Nettie: I'll see if there's anything in Master Halsin's notes.
Nettie: He didn't find a cure, but maybe we can make you comfortable.

Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Player discovers an improvised shrine to a dead drow warrior. There's a helmet resting on a sword that's been rammed into a stone. You can take the helmet, but you'll need to think of another way to get the sword free.

Narrator: *A slender drow blade impales the stone before you, keeping a silent vigil.*
Narrator: *You recognise your goddess' rite - a warrior's sacrifice. Only blood, freely given, will honour the fallen.*
Player: This feels holy. Consider what the appropriate ritual might be.
: True
Narrator: *This blade was a warrior's sacrifice to Eilistraee. Blood can only be honoured with blood.*

Synopsis: Raft dialogue. The player can decide either to sail somewhere or to walk away from the raft.

Narrator: *The craft is ready to sail.* || [context] InternalNodeContext: ~Should share sequence with *A vessel wobbles on the lake's murky waters.*

~[EA: Treat this like it's propelled by sails, there is not rowing or special animations for this]

----- Session: RaftEvent -----
Synopsis: The players use a boat to reach the duergar camp. In the middle of the lake, they are confronted by a group of duergar on a raft. Being Drow/Duergar changes the tone of the conversation and makes the persuasion event easier. Having the mark of the Absolute can also make the persuasion event easier.

Corsair Greymon: Godsdamned dwarf. What are you doing on Gekh's raft?
Corsair Greymon: Where's Gekh? Who are you?
Player: Duergar, like you? Saw his body a way back. Myconids got him.
: False
Corsair Greymon: What a load of rothé shite. No way a mushroom killed Gekh.
Corsair Greymon: Get them, fellas!

======== Scenario: und_thedrownere ========
Session Sequence: Mindmeld -> 
----- Session: Mindmeld -----
Synopsis: A mindmeld with a True Soul through a brick wall - the connection is unstable because of this, and we do not hear everything the True Soul says.

Narrator: *As you near the rubble, a fragmented voice clutches at your mind.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Nere starting to Mindmeld with the player
Nere: A Tru... Sou... True Soul? || [context] NodeContext: The original line is 'A True Soul? This is Nere. Tell those Imbiciles to hurry up! I am choking on poison.' Should be recorded normally, and effects should be added later to make it sound like the voice is fading in and out.
Nere: Finally! You must clear... rubble. Filling... poison!
Player: Stay still. I'll do what I can.
Nere: ...it quick or... head! Careful... mercs... on the edge...
Nere: ...Get me OUT!
Narrator: *The view through Nere's eyes is a blur. You only make out a bit of rubble and few moving figures.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: View from Nere's persepective Vision blurred and
Player: Try to focus. What more can you see?
: False
Narrator: *The harder you look, the fuzzier the images become, until there is only grey.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Image blurs before greying out/fading to black

----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Dialogue with Nere after you fought the duergar with him and he sent you away either to find help in Moonrise or simply to leave him alone. His cold malice and zealotry should shine through.

Nere: Didn't I tell you to go to Moonrise Towers? The General must be told of my situation.

Synopsis: Main dialogue with creepy myconid sovereign. He wants you to kill some duergar that are left from when they attacked these mushroom creatures. Myconids are part of a "circle", kind of a hive mind. They speak in visions, with music - all telepathically. This should be otherworldly and slightly disturbing.

Narrator: *Hums. Clicks. Harmonies. They drift through you like an unknown language.*
Narrator: *Then, visions. Dark dwarves - duergar - chopping fungal tendrils with their axes.*
Sovereign Spaw: ((*the dark intruders broke our peace. they killed our young*))
Sovereign Spaw: ((*we laid waste to many. others remain*))
Narrator: *You see another vision: your lifeless body, wrapped in tendrils. The sovereign is threatening you.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Vision can be a simple linear pose to pose transition, portraying a single action
Player: Do you truly wish to do battle with a great warrior?
: True
Narrator: *Fungal roots weave through your mind, seeking your true intent.* || [approval] ['Gale 1', 'Shadowheart 1', 'Wyll 1', 'Karlach 1']
Narrator: *The sovereign drones a new melody, cautious but insistent.*
Sovereign Spaw: ((*the Rot festers. duergar remain. lakeward*))
Narrator: *The sovereign's song halts as it measures your might.*
Sovereign Spaw: ((*I will reward. you cleanse the Rot. you destroy them*))

Synopsis: Players can find a few NPCs that have been raised by the myconoid to work as their servants. The party comments on this through a VB.This can fire on any character, and since it is not a result of direct player actions, the replies can be fairly opinionated.Can take one or two speakers.

Player: So those mushrooms can raise the dead? That's... interesting.
Player: Handy magic, that. Maybe it'll be of use to us.

Narrator: *As you look at the skeletons, you realise they are all clad in the same dark armour.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Surveying a group of Skeletons clad in Dark Justiciar uniforms (in game objects exist).
Karlach: No burial. Just slaughter. Damn.

----- Session: DwarvenAlchemist -----
Synopsis: Derryth is a dwarven alchemist visiting the underdark from Baldur's Gate. She runs a shop in the city with Baelen, her business partner. They've come to the underdark in search of a very valuable mushroom - noblestalk. When the player arrived, she was tending to an injured gnome.
Derryth is a bit gruff - she's a healer, but her bedside manner leaves a lot to be desired. She's also a very shrewd businessperson. She's in the underdark to get rich first and foremost.
She treats her business partner (Baelen) like he's an idiot, and pretends not to care about him, but in reality he is the most important person to her in the world.

Derryth Bonecloak: Seems the 'shrooms are letting in more people every day. || [context] NodeContext: Not friendly. She's got a real squint in her eye taking you in.
Derryth Bonecloak: You see a fella on his own on your way in? Dwarf. Baelen's his name.
Player: Haven't seen him.
Derryth Bonecloak: Right. Never mind.
Player: Need some help finding him? || [approval] ['Wyll 1', 'Karlach 1']
Derryth Bonecloak: Knock yourself out. But don't come begging for coin if you find him.
Derryth Bonecloak: If you try to ransom him to me, you'll find yourself skint and stuck with a fat old lout.

----- Session: AD_CheckpointGuard_002_Combat -----
Synopsis: One-shot combat AD to play when the myconid is taking their turn.

Restless Myconid: ((*the disease still festers. I will cut it out*))

----- Session: CheckpointGuard_001 -----
Synopsis: Individual myconid responds with one-liner after you have gained access to the myconid circle. Hallucinogenic delivery.

Narrator: *The creature's song rumbles within you, neither warm nor welcoming.*

----- Session: VB_GlutDead_1P -----
Synopsis: Players refuse to kill Sovereign Spawn on Sovereign Glut's behalf. Glut has attacked the players and is now dead. The party comments afterwards.

Player: The usurper is dead. So much for 'Circle Glut'.

----- Session: CheckpointGuard_000 -----
Synopsis: You come upon the myconid guards. They warn the sovereign of your presence telepathically, and it begins to speak to you. This should be creepy, hallucinatory.

Narrator: *You are swallowed by a chorus of turbulent music. Through one creature sing many voices: the harmony of an entire collective.*
Restless Myconid: ((*Sovereign. they have come. they are here*))
Narrator: *The choir fades. A single melody rises above the others, brassy and commanding.*
: ((*I am Sovereign*))
Narrator: *You see a vision: your lifeless body, wrapped in fungal tendrils. The sovereign is threatening you.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Player closes eyes as if seeing the vision in their head.
: ((*state your purpose*))

----- Session: DeepRothe -----
Synopsis: A Deep Rothe that belongs to Derryth and Baelen Bonecloak. A beast of burden with a simple Speak with Animals dialogue. There's some reactivity depending on whether Baelen has returned to the bonecloak camp or not, and if Baelen recovered his senses by eating the noblestalk mushroom. The animal's observations reinforce that Baelen has been more amiable and gentle since his mind began to slip, and his recovery is not seen as a good thing by all.

Deep Rothé: Master sounds different, like old self. Angry self. Don't like. || [context] NodeContext: SWA line. Reproachful. A simple beast of burden senses his master has returned to a crueler demeanour.

 Next block: you have killed all the duergars; now it wants you to kill the sovereign
. 
Final block: you have killed the sovereign and it rewards you. 

This myconid does not speak with the same hive mind voice of the others. He should sound creepy, like FART in Rick and Morty, with a SLIGHT undercurrent of menace.

 As the quest moves on, he gets more and more creepy and angry,

Sovereign Glut: ((*the tumour is excised. the duergar are dead*))

She's slowly succumbing to poison - initially vague and feverish. If we heal her, she's exhausted but straight back on task, giving us the job of freeing her people.

Omeluum: I greet you, sun child.
Player: How do you survive? Don't you need... brains?
Omeluum: In the beginning, I had an arrangement with a lich. Excellent company, despite what one would expect.
Omeluum: I required brains, he required souls. A perfect symbiosis.
Omeluum: But our ambitions eventually splintered. I wished to better the world, and he preferred its rot.
Omeluum: So I left his company, and thus I now feed from those who... act against the Society's goals.
Player: That's disgusting. You're a monster.
Omeluum: I cannot change my appetites. Although I am experimenting in reducing them with magic.
Omeluum: Perhaps with time, it can be one brain a year instead of one a month...
Omeluum: I greet you, sun child.

Narrator: *The injured man locks eyes with you. A familiar squirming churns in your head.*
Player: Move away, reaching for your weapon.
Narrator: *Your limbs do not obey. Your minds intertwine. You see his siblings - Andrick and Brynna. New recruits. Yours to shepherd.*
Edowin: Protect them.

They will - they - they... || [context] CinematicNodeContext: *Huddock smiled before falling still with a final, bloody wheeze of air.*NodeContext: Validated - he thought he sensed a likeminded individual, and was proven correct.

======== Scenario: for_gnomegoblin1 ========
Session Sequence:  -> AD_InvestigateMill -> AD_UnfortunateGnomeGone -> Dead
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: The party comes across a trio of goblins who've captured a gnome and have turned to tormenting him - they've tied him to a windmill and are watching him spin around. The party can try to intervene and save the gnome, possibly using a cult symbol of authority as a way to convince the goblins, if they have it. FOR_GnomeGoblin_1 (Fezzerk) is the leader of the goblins and does most of the talking. If the player is a drow, the goblins will be much more nervous and easier to intimidate. At times, the captive goblin pipes up from the windmill, loudly pleading or berating his captors.

Fezzerk: Look what we got here - another little birdie wantin' to fly! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Cinematic/look-at context - Fezzerk notices us and calls out to his cronies. (The line is addressed to the goblin raider and scavenger, but Fezzerk's attention is broadly held by the player.NodeContext: Cruel bravado.The goblin sees the player approach and boldly announces it to his cronies - he thinks some fresh victims have just turned up.
Fezzerk: Yehehueh! Flap those wings some more, an' I'll feed you a worm! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Cinematic/look-at context - Fezzerk calls out to taunt his deep gnome prisoner, who rotates on the sail of a windmill a short-moderate distance off.NodeContext: Greatly amused. A schoolyard bully tormenting the little kid. Projecting his voice a little (Fezzerk calls out to taunt his deep gnome prisoner, who rotates on the sail of a windmill a short-moderate distance off.)
'Yehehueh!' = Fezzerk's distinct laugh (a raspy, mean-spirited slur of a laugh)
Fezzerk: An' you - hope you got a stomach fer heights! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The goblin turns back to the player (if the gnome inclusion line triggered - otherwise he's facing the player the whole time.)NodeContext: Confident, unpleasant. Turning his attention to the player to deliver a threat.
Player: I'm not looking for trouble - just want to pass by.
Fezzerk: Heh, funny. That's what our birdie wanted. || [context] NodeContext: Mocking. Refers to the player's previous statement ('I don't want trouble - just want to pass by').
Barcus Wroot: ...Release me this instant, you beasts! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Context - the deep gnome yells at his captors as he swings into earshotNodeContext: Panicked, angry. Issuing an ultimatum even though he has no means of following through on it.
Fezzerk: 'Less you wanna join him up there, you'd best pay the toll. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The lead goblin looks at his hands and tries to calculate a figure with his fingers.NodeContext: Fezzerk mockingly refers to the deep gnome's predicament as he threatens the player. 'Passing by' refers to rotating on a windmill rather than safe passage through the area, in his book.
Fezzerk: Cough it up! ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54]) || [context] InternalNodeContext: The idea is the goblin is a bit dim greedy and throwing out a stupidly high number.NodeContext: Fezzerk declares his price. (A ridiculously high sum - questionable whether he truly knows how absurd a demand this is)
Narrator: *A strange symbol glows, marked on their flesh, and something within you stirs in response.*
Player: I'm going to pay nothing, and you and your cronies are going to leave.
: True
Fezzerk: Y-you're a True Soul... I didn't know. Wouldn't dare question you, never!
Narrator: *The presence deep in your mind is awake, unblinking. This is it. A single word pervades your consciousness: 'Soon'.*
Fezzerk: We'll, erm, we'll leave you to it. || [approval] ['Gale 1', 'Shadowheart 5', 'Karlach 1']

----- Session: AD_InvestigateMill -----
Synopsis: Some goblins tormenting a gnome tied to a windmill are surprised when it stops rotating.

Fezzerk: Why's the spinnymajigger stopped? Get it moving again! || [context] NodeContext: Impatient and suspicious.The windmill that the goblins are using to torment their captive has stopped - their leader wants his cronies to investigate and get the windmill working again.

----- Session: AD_UnfortunateGnomeGone -----
Synopsis: The goblins are leaving after witnessing their captive gnome get launched from the blade of a windmill at high speed. Now that their amusement's been catapulted away, they have no reason to linger.

Fezzerk: Look's like the fun's over. C'mon, let's see who else we can snatch. || [context] NodeContext: Calling to his assembled goblin cronies - 'c'mon fellas, let's wrap it up here.'

----- Session: Dead -----
Synopsis: A speak with dead dialogue with a slain goblin, Fezzerk. As he's been just temporarily resurrrected from the afterlife, he speaks in slow, cryptic, fragmented phrases. From him, the player can gain a little insight into their hostage-taking activities. If Fezzerk recognises the player as his killer, he won't speak at all.

Narrator: *The corpse regards you lifelessly.*
Fezzerk: Urgh... cold... || [context] NodeContext: A cryptic, fragmented croak, spoken by a temporarily-resurrected corpse.
Player: Who are you?
Fezzerk: Fezzerk... best raider... east o' the... Sea o' Swords... || [context] NodeContext: A cryptic, fragmented croak, spoken by a temporarily-resurrected corpse.

Barcus Wroot: Urrrgh... magga cammara - those pustulent thugs! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Cinematic/actor context - the deep gnome sways dizzilyNodeContext: 'Magga cammara' pronounced 'Mag-ah cam-ah-rah'. Gnomish exclamation meaning 'by the stones'.
Barcus the deep gnome is suffering some grogginess after spinning on the sail of a windmill for the last while.
Barcus Wroot: Well - get on with it. || [context] NodeContext: Still a little out of sorts after his ordeal spinning on a windmill, now a mixture of resigned and annoyed. He's expecting you to extort him now.
Player: Get on with what?
Barcus Wroot: I'm a deep gnome, you're a drow. You helped me, now you plan to enslave me.
Player: That's not what I want.
Barcus Wroot: What, then? Torture? Bloodsport? Or perhaps just a good old-fashioned walloping?
Player: You owe me nothing. || [approval] ['Astarion -1', 'Gale 1', 'Wyll 1', 'Karlach 1']
Barcus Wroot: Nothing?
Player: I could extort you, if that's what you want.
Barcus Wroot: You're teasing me now. I'm certain of it.
Barcus Wroot: Take my pack if you can find it. The only reason those goblins caught me was its weight. I'll travel lightly from now on. || [context] InternalNodeContext: Has not offered pack yet.
Player: Leave.

----- Session: AD -----
Synopsis: If the player gets the windmill to stop spinning, then clicks Barcus, Barcus will get these lines. Barcus will be impatient, mistrustful of the player, but still in need of player's help.

----- Session: TiedUp -----
Synopsis: The player has stopped the windmill from rotating and can now cut Barcus Wroot, the captive gnome, free from its sails. They can do this immediately, or else demand payment first, much to the gnome's frustration.

Barcus Wroot: Cut me loose! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The gnome is tied to the (stationary) sail of a wind, begging to be cut free by the player. He's close to the ground and within normal speaking range.NodeContext: Urgent, panicked. The gnome begs to be untied from the sail of a windmill. The sail is at the lowermost part of its rotation in relation to the ground, and the gnome is within normal speaking range.
Player: What's in it for me? || [context] NodeContext: Incredulous. His good samaritan seems to be haggling for a reward before even freeing him.
Barcus Wroot: Free me and find out. || [context] NodeContext: Impatient. He's used to being extorted.
Player: Leave him.

----- Session: AD_RotatingFasterReaction -----

======== Scenario: for_owlbear ========
Session Sequence: LastCub ->  -> AD_HatchedEgg
----- Session: LastCub -----
Synopsis: In SwA, this cub speaks in short bursts - he sounds staccato, vicious.The player has killed an owlbear - a large, predatory wild animal. The owlbear's cub remains however, and lingers by his dead mother. The player can decide whether to put the cub out of its misery, or else leave it. If the player has the speak with animals skill, they get some additional insight into the cub's anxiety. If the player lets the cub live, it will proceed to eat its mother - it's still a wild animal, after all.

Narrator: *The cub looks from you to his dead mother.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The cub looks from dead mother to the player, wailing.NodeContext: Narrator node!
Owlbear Cub: *Braawww!*

----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: In SwA, the owlbear speaks like a human. Her voice is deep and threatening - the voice of a seasoned fighter, at home in a fight and used to winning. However, she knows she's injured and at a disadvantage, but refuses to betray that to the player. Doing so might encourage the player to attack, putting her cub in danger.The player stumbles upon the nest of an owlbear; a large, predatory hybrid creature. They find themselves in a stand-off against the beast - if they get too close or act aggressively, it attacks. If they keep cool and back off when the opportunity presents itself, the owlbear will let them leave. The player may also notice that the owlbear is wounded - a broken spear protrudes from one eye socket. They may notice that the owlbear has a cub - this is the main reason for her aggression and territoriality.Additional note 1: the player may stumble upon this scenario by themselves, or they may have been pointed in the right direction after meeting some cultists who had a close encounter with the owlbear. If we won these cultists over, they may be available to fight the owlbear at our side.Additional note 2: If the owlbear mother is killed but her cub survives, we can decide the juvenile's fate. If we spare it, we may later find it being used for sport by the goblins in their camp.

Narrator: *You feel the quake of its heavy footsteps before you see it: an owlbear, its beaked face looming out of the darkness.* || [context] InternalNodeContext: This greeting if the player doesn't have Speak with Animals.
Owlbear: *Growl.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Ready to pounce.
Player: Study the owlbear's behaviour.

Narrator: *The owlbear's one good eye flicks away for a moment. You follow its glance...* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The owlbear glances over
Narrator: *...and see an owlbear cub.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Cub is highlighted.
Player: Move toward the cub.

Synopsis: The party comes across a trio of goblins who've captured a gnome and have turned to tormenting him - they've tied him to windmill sail and are rotating him for their amusement. The party can try to intervene and save the gnome, possiblyby using their mind-influencing powers or otherwise convincing the goblins they're on the same side. GnomeGobllin3 is one of two lackeys, there to support the leading goblin, Fezzerk. She's abrupt and aggressive to most, though servile and meek if the player happens to be a drow.

Player: Who are you?
Gomwick: ... Gomwick...

----- Session: Dog -----
Synopsis: In SwA, Scratch speaks like a human. He doesn't have any kind of dog-like affectation, nor is he stupid - he's well-spoken, even when he's saying 'dog' things. Throughout the dialogue, he's stoic but heartbroken, deluding himself into believing that his master is not dead.We come across the corpse of a man being protected by his loyal dog, Scratch.The dog refuses to let us near the dead man or his belongings, forcing us to try and win him over (or else just kill him). We can use Speak with Animals to get further insight into the dog's perspective.
 If we cast Speak with Dead upon the courier, we can learn the dog's name and use this as an additional way to win it over.

--- Scenario Details ---
======== Scenario: hag_gurhunter ========
Session Sequence: PAD_BetrayedAstarion
----- Session: PAD_BetrayedAstarion -----
Synopsis: PAD that plays if you decide to tell the Gur Hunter in the Swamp where to find Astarion (HAG_GurHunter.lsj).  You tell the Hunter where your camp is, the Hunter says he'll take Astarion during the night the next time you go to sleep, then the dialog ends and this PAD plays.Your companion reacts to your decision to hand Astarion over (speaker 2) and then you clarify/justify your decision (speaker 1)

Player: You gave him up? I wasn't sure you would.
Player: He's too dangerous to have around. We'd always be sleeping with one eye open.

======== Scenario: hag_hagambush ========
Session Sequence: PAD_SidedHag
----- Session: PAD_SidedHag -----
Synopsis: This VB plays after saving Ethel from the two brothers of the sister she's holding captive. Ether disappeared in a magic puff, and she was acting suspicious. The players are reacting to her exit and discussing that there may be more to Ethel than meets the eye.Speaker 1 may have been the character who was in dialog for the scene with Ethel. Speaker 2 is another party member. However, since there may be combat, this setup isn't guaranteed and it's best to write this assuming everyone had a hand in the actions that led to this VB playing.

Player: Bloody way to end an argument. I hope we chose the right side.
Player: No point in debating what's already done. Let's go on ahead.

Player: If that's the case, we've got more problems than just the worms in our heads.

Synopsis: If Halsin is killed in bear form in the Wolf Pens and the party knew about Halsin, the companions comment on the fact that the large dead elf who can turn in to a bear was probably the druid they were sent to find. Oops.

Session Sequence: PAD_EnteringGoblinCamp
----- Session: PAD_EnteringGoblinCamp -----
Synopsis: Thematically, this VB is a conversation about the goblin camp and how difficult it might be to find the druid there. Player will be aware that he's being held captive somewhere in the camp and can see the goblins's strength.This occurs over walking into a trigger, so lines between speaker 1 and speaker 2 can be fairly opinionated.

Player: The druid Halsin is in here somewhere.
Player: Let's hope we find him in one piece.

----- Session: ConfrontationLaezel -----

----- Session: CINE_RiderAndDragonLeave -----
Synopsis: Cinematic: Kith'rak Voss flies away on his dragon.The player interrupted the Gith Chokepoint situation. The most likely interruption is triggering a combat (player attacks any npc there including Voss or the dragon, or drags another hostile npc near them)This interruption happens in gameplay, so normally the Rider (Kith'rak Voss) and the Dragon would also leave in gameplay, but animations don't have the tech support to make the Rider ride the dragon like this, so we play this cutscene instead

[desc] CinematicNodeContext: ~The dragon spreads its wings and soars away.
NOTE: this could be used in a number of circumstances in which Voss flies away. Voss is an arrogant senior gith officer, focused on his mission, so he can always depart while being unfazed by preceeding events. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: ~The dragon spreads its wings and soars away.
