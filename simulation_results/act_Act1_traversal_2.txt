======== Scenario: den_tieflingbard ========
Session Sequence: Bard -> AD_StartingOver -> AD_InstrumentBroken
----- Session: Bard -----
Synopsis: Alfira is a young bard who was apprenticed to a woman called Lihala. On their journey to the camp, they were attacked by gnolls, and Lihala died horribly.
Alfira is trying to compose a song in honour of the teacher she loved so dearly, but is struggling. The player can help her play, talk ther through the lyrics, steal her instrument, or even convince her to give up music.
This is a very soft and touching moment in the grove. Should Alfira finish her song (with the aid of the player) she will stand up and sing it in a cinematic scene.

Alfira: Dance upon the stars tonight. Smile and pain will fade away. Words of mine will change - no. Become - ugh. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Lightly strumming her lute. Not looking at the player. NodeContext: Softly singing. Sadness in every note. There is a small pause between every line as you softly sing.
Player: What's that tune you're singing?
Alfira: More like butchering. Don't know why I bother. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Looking at lute - frustratedNodeContext: Speaking of her own music. Embarassed and frustrated with herself. Dejected.
Player: Are you all right?
Alfira: No. I'm moments away from a grisly death... || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Looks at player. NodeContext: Sarcasm mixed with frustation.
Alfira: ...at the hands of this bloody song. I can't... nothing fits, you know? || [context] NodeContext: Annoyed and frustrated with herself.
Player: Why are you songwriting now? Hardly the best time.
Alfira: I... we lost people on the way here. || [context] NodeContext: She's thinking of her teacher who died on the way. Grief in her voice.
Alfira: And the dead deserve to be remembered. That's what my teacher always said. || [context] NodeContext: She's thinking of her teacher who died on the way. Grief in her voice.
Player: This grove could become a battlefield soon enough. It's not the time for music.
Alfira: I know. I should be packing up, but I need to finish this song. It's... it's important. || [context] NodeContext: Player has advised her to leave. But she can't - she has to finish her song. Frustrated, mainly at herself.
Player: Snatch the lute out of her hands and smash it. || [approval] ['Astarion 1', 'Gale -1', "Lae'zel 1", 'Wyll -1', 'Karlach -1']
: True
[desc] CinematicNodeContext: Player grabs the lute out of Alfira's hands and smashes it on the ground. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Player grabs the lute out of Alfira's hands and smashes it on the ground.
Alfira: What did you do?! My teacher gave me that! And she - and she's dead, you bastard. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Stands up. NodeContext: Player smashed your lute - you're hysterical and furious.
Alfira: I wanted to write a song for her and you - you ruined it. You ruined everything. || [context] NodeContext: Break down crying.

----- Session: AD_StartingOver -----
Synopsis: AD that plays after the bard has been told to start over. She is holding her lute. Not plucking it occasionally but not really playing.

Alfira: No. That's stupid. || [context] NodeContext: Player has convinced her to start from scratch with the song. Doubts herself. Hates what she's working on. Dejected.

======== Scenario: den_ngb ========
Session Sequence: 
======== Scenario: den_adventurersquest ========
Session Sequence: RaidAdventurerAtCorpses -> RaidAdventurer -> VB_AtCorpses -> LeaderAtCorpses -> AD_RemiraBarthAtCorpses
----- Session: RaidAdventurerAtCorpses -----
Synopsis: The adventurer is standing next to the corpses of her comrades she left behind while running for the goblins.

Remira: I told them to run, the idiots.
Remira: You better turn north here, or you'll end up like them.

----- Session: RaidAdventurer -----
Synopsis: Age: mid-30-40s.
Female
Bio: Rough and working-class. A veteran of many expeditions, Remira is nonetheless shaken after a raid gone horribly wrong and trying to hide it behind bravado. She feels guilty for leaving a new recruit to die, but tries to wave it away and gets defensive if confronted over it. She’s sarcastic and casually racist.

Remira: Ah, the fighting foulblood. Glad to know one of you has a spine. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: She cleans her wound, a cut on her arm with a [cleaning cloth]
Player: I already regret saving your life.
Remira: Ah - bruised your feelings, did I? Excuse me if I don't weep - got problems of my own. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Finishes cleaning wound and puts the [cleaning cloth] away.
Remira: My arm's near hanging off after wise Zevlor left us to die at the gate.
Remira: And then he has the bloody gall to try and blame it all on us.
Player: He let you in, didn't he? It could have been worse.
Remira: Oh, very gracious of you. || [context] NodeContext: You're trying to be gracious and she's not having any of it.
Remira: We expected a soft job. Something to test the new lad, maybe, but not a bloody goblin nest. || [context] NodeContext: She's justifying her actions - they'd taken on a job that seemed simple but quickly got out of hand. People died and she's doggedly maintaining that she's the victim. More explanatory than whiny, though.
Remira: Most would've turned tail at the sight. But not Liam, no - he charged them, the stupid bastard. || [context] NodeContext: She's genuinely hurt at the loss of this recruit but projecting a knowing persona to hide it, as if his bravery is somehow a rookie mistake. Note of incredulity rather than laughing at him, as if he did something very stupid.
Player: Leave.

----- Session: VB_AtCorpses -----
Synopsis: Remarking on corpses on the road.

Player: Dead goblins, dead travellers.
Player: I wonder where they were going.

Loic: Shadow Druids... To think we were rotting from within. I'm sorry. I need a moment. || [context] InternalNodeContext: TODO: Add Shadow Druid Flag. Reaction for after the player exposed the Shadow druid plot. I don't know if he'll be part of the druids who fight alongside Sagha (I don't know if all pro-sagha druids do).

Session Sequence: VB_UnlockedStudy -> FrescoFoundingGrove -> FrescoAlliance -> VB_BrokenRunes -> PAD_UnlockWithCirclet -> FrescoVictory -> VB_ObtainedReward
----- Session: VB_UnlockedStudy -----

Narrator: <br>*'In darkest hour, a concord made,<br>'Twixt harp and wild against the shade.'*<br>

: True

----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Nadira is a witty tiefling that survived Avernus and escaped with a soul coin, a valuable currency of the Hells. She suspects the player works for the original owner of the coin, a devilish erinyes, and will have to be persuaded in order to hand it over.

Nadira: You have good timing. Never been much of a fighter, so wrestling a bugbear would have gone poorly.
Nadira: But you're not here for heroics, are you? Avernus' stench is all over your skin.
Nadira: Let me guess: your devil mistress sent you to get her soul coin back. Too bad. I earned it fair and square.
Karlach: Oh man, a soul coin? Wouldn't mind getting my hands on that... || [context] NodeContext: Very interested but maybe downplaying her interest.
Player: That bugbear would have crushed your skull. This is the thanks I get?
Nadira: Why thank you, dread slayer of bugbears. You shall live forever in my memory. || [context] NodeContext: Dramatically exaggerated/sarcastic.
Nadira: Now take my regards back to that pouting erinyes and leave me alone. || [context] NodeContext: Very flat, almost cold.
Player: How about this? You give me the coin. Now.
Player: You hand the coin over, or I kill you. How about that?
: True
Nadira: Considering you turned that bugbear into paste... || [approval] ['Shadowheart 1', 'Karlach 1']

Lines play sequentially, each druid saying one line, then the next, etc.They're chanting at a normal to low volume. They're attempting to suss power out from the earth itself, but they're not forcing it out. There should be a loose rhythm to it (think Arwen from LoTR when she summons the river horses), but it shouldn't come across like a drum circle.

======== Scenario: den_prodigy ========
Session Sequence: Group -> Sister -> Brother
----- Session: Group -----
Synopsis: Three people are having an argument. Rolan, Lia and Cal. Lia and Cal are brother and sister, but the three of them have grown up together. They're young, talented tieflings who are heading to Baldur's Gate to start their lives and careers. Rolan argues that they should leave now and get to the city while they still can. Lia argues that it is irresponsible to leave their kin behind. Cal is stuck in the middle.
This is a passionate and fiery argument, both sides are convinced that they are correct.

Lia: Hells, we can't just leave. They're kin. || [context] NodeContext: This is the start of the dialog but clearly an ongoing argument. You think it's your responsibility, as a tiefling, to stay and help your kin. You're angry, voice is level but will soon grow louder, and utterly convinced that staying at the camp is the right thing to do.
Rolan: I'll not gamble our lives, our futures, on people who are as good as dead. We must leave for Baldur's Gate - at once. || [context] NodeContext: You're angry but your voice is level. You think staying at the camp is essentially suicide. You cannot believe it was even suggested. You and your friends have brand new lives waiting for you in Baldur's Gate - to stay at the camp is reckless and pointless to you.
Cal: Can we all just take a moment? Please? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Looking for one to the other. Stuck in between them, pleading. Hands out as he tries to calm the situation. NodeContext: Your friend and sister are screaming at each other in front of you. Light and easygoing tone as you try to calm the argument.
Lia: What's the point in blades and spells if we don't bloody use them? We should stay. || [context] NodeContext: Your voice is getting louder. You're very angry now. It's your civic duty to use the skills you have to help people. You cannot believe how selfish Rolan is being.
Lia: These people aren't fighters. We can help. || [context] NodeContext: Ibid.
Cal: Or yell louder. That's fine too. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Sighing as he shrugs. He knows neither is listening to him. NodeContext: Your friend and sister have ignored your plea. You know once they've started they'll just keep arguing until one of them gives in. This is almost said with a shrug and in a light, jokey tone.
Player: You should all stay. A single blade could make a difference. || [approval] ['Gale 1', 'Karlach 1']
: False
Rolan: No. This place is a death trap. Let us leave - immediately! || [context] NodeContext: Player has disagreed with you. You're frustrated and angry. You think it's ludicrous that anyone would disagree with you.
Rolan: Or would you deny your brother here his chance at fortune in Baldur's Gate? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Looking at Lia but gesturing to Cal. NodeContext: You know the argument is likely going your way and you're being a little bit of a dick here. You know mentioning Lia's brother is a guarantee that she'll give in to your side and leave with you. It's a bit of an underhanded move.
Player: You want fortune? There's coin in it if you stay.
Lia: You know, that money could go towards a spiffy new outfit for your apprenticeship...? || [context] NodeContext: Smile, knowing rolan will give in
Rolan: Zurgan. Fine. Give it here. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Generic 'taking' animation. Taking coin from the player.NodeContext: 'ZUR-gan.' Frustrated but giving in to the promise of going.
Rolan: If we survive, it'll make for a good story I suppose... || [context] NodeContext: Kinda sulky but accepting that you'll stay in the grove.
Lia: Thank you, Rolan. And thank you, friend. || [context] NodeContext: Warm and sincere. Directed at rolan and then player.

----- Session: Brother -----
Synopsis: This dialog occurs after the argument between Lia and Rolan that Cal attempted to mediate. It's light and friendly, and mainly a chance for the player to get to know Cal.

Cal: Lia and Rolan would never admit it, but they'd take an arrow for the other. Also stab each other. Not sure what'll come first. || [context] NodeContext: You have broken up a fight between Lia and Rolan more times than you can count. You're tone is light and friendly as you joke with the player.
Cal: Thanks for cutting in - there might have been more than words if you hadn't. || [context] NodeContext: A big friendly smile - you are the most genuine of the group

--- Scenario Details ---
======== Scenario: gob_checkpoint ========
Session Sequence: AlarmUsedReaction -> Guard005 -> Guard004 -> Worg_001 -> CliffWarning -> ThreeWayDialogWithCapturedGoblin -> Guard003 -> Backup002 -> TopCliffWarning -> Guard002 -> Worg_002 -> Trespassing -> Guard001
----- Session: AlarmUsedReaction -----
Synopsis: The player used the alarm drum, which is meant to alert other guards that there are enemies attacking. Depending on who the player is and how they performed, the goblins around the alarm will either be impressed, neutral, or willing to fight.

Sentinel Olak: That's lovely stuff, True Soul. Only... we smack that drum so the lads know there's killin' on. || [context] NodeContext: Goblin repsects player and is impressed by the song they played.
Sentinel Olak: Not to worry! I'll set 'em straight. Bit of music never hurt anyone, eh? || [context] NodeContext: Bright, cheerful, reassuring you

----- Session: Guard005 -----
Synopsis: Goblin standing on a hill. Fibbing like a child about what he can see.

Sharp-Eye Snurd: I can see the Absolute from here. I can! || [context] NodeContext: (He can't).

----- Session: Guard004 -----
Synopsis: Goblin grunt guarding a checkpoint. Laconic; gruff.

Tracker Rindle: Eh? || [context] InternalNodeContext: fallback for alt entry pathsNodeContext: Player is allowed inside; 'leave me alone' intention here.

----- Session: Worg_001 -----
Synopsis: Squirrely, quick-breathing, animalian worg (wolf-like creature) stands guard at a checkpoint with its masters.

Klaw: Wearin' me muck. Muck on ya. Good muck. || [context] NodeContext: Sniffing and snuffling at the shit on your face. Spoken quickly, primal.

----- Session: CliffWarning -----
Synopsis: Goblin warns an intruder to leave

Sharp-Eye Snurd: Oi, thicko! This here's off-limits. Get to the main gate, or I'll plug you full o' arrows. || [context] NodeContext: Warning an intruder to leave  - shouting last line

----- Session: ThreeWayDialogWithCapturedGoblin -----
Synopsis: If the player released the captured goblin in Halsin's den, the CG will be waiting for the player at the checkpoint. When the player starts the dialog with the main guard at the checkpoint (or gets closer to him) and the CG is at the checkpoint, this dialog is shown. After this dialog, the CG leaves the checkpoint and the main guard gets his normal dialog back.

Synopsis: 

(Session contained no nodes with text or context)

======== Scenario: und_mushroomhunter ========
Session Sequence:  -> Dead
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Baelan, a mushroom hunter,  is surrounded by dangeous Bibberbang mushrooms. He was trying to get to the Noblestalk mushroom, but one of the stone ledges collapsed underneath him and he fell down. His partner Derryth (Dwarven Alchemist) is in the Myconid Village. Important: Baelan seems to have trouble keeping his train of thought - he loses track of his responses, changes the subject and generally seems out of sorts at times. Later, it will be confirmed that he's been suffering from a dementia-like condition for some years now.

Baelen Bonecloak: Stop, STOP! || [context] NodeContext: In a loud, panicked whisper.
Baelen Bonecloak: Bibberbang! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Motions to the mushrooms surrounding him, then mimes 'blowing up'.NodeContext: A warning of nearby danger
: False
Player: Bibber-what? Speak plainly, won't you?
Baelen Bonecloak: These mushrooms - toxic! || [context] NodeContext: Urgent. He's basically standing in the middle of a mine field of sorts.
Baelen Bonecloak: Scroll - escape! My bag! Please. I've dropped it - somewhere! || [context] NodeContext: Urgent. He's basically standing in the middle of a mine field of sorts.
Player: This is your mess - figure it out yourself. || [approval] ['Astarion 1', 'Wyll -1', 'Karlach -1']
Baelen Bonecloak: Bloody drow! || [context] NodeContext: Reacting to a drow/dark elf abandoning him to his fate.
Baelen Bonecloak: I-I mean... I didn't mean that. || [context] NodeContext: Backpedalling on his previous insult - he still needs help.
Baelen Bonecloak: Please - can't... can't get out... || [context] NodeContext: Dejected and worried.

----- Session: Dead -----
Synopsis: Baelen was out hunting Noblestalk when he was trapped in a field of explosive mushrooms. He's now dead - most likely because the player triggered those mushrooms to explode. He speaks in short, cryptic fragments from beyond the grave.

Narrator: *The corpse regards you lifelessly.*
Player: Who are you?
Baelen Bonecloak: Baelen... Bonecloak...

Corsair Greymon: Well I'll be ploughed sideways - we got a welcoming party. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The boat arrives. Greymon on a boat.
Morghal: You shithead - time you showed up. We got trouble. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: To Greymon. Projected from the boat. Morgha is talking to him from the shore.NodeContext: Projected voice
Corsair Greymon: Spit it out. Sergeant finally choked on True Soul Nere's prick? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: To Morghal, from the docking boat.NodeContext: Projected voice

Elder Brithvar: Someone should grab it. Slaves are never gonna manage with pickaxes. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: To Kur
Stone Guard Kur: Can't go chasing 'maybes' - the sergeant's our ticket in. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: To Brithvar
Elder Brithvar: Would you look at that, Kur. Someone's having a listen. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Brithvar turns and notices player. Addressed to Kur, looking at player
Narrator: *A shiver runs through you. Your mind is awash in ancient resentments.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Not a mindmeld but a resonance due to duergar's psionic sensitivity.
Elder Brithvar: True Soul, no less. What do you think, Kur - should we take Nere's debt off them? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Addressed to Kur, looking at player
Player: Why would you think I'm a True Soul?
Elder Brithvar: The stench - all you Twat-Souls got one. Some of us got a nose for it.

Beldron: The leader of our expedition. He was sent off to Moonrise Towers.
Beldron: We were just slave-hands to the cult, but not Wulbren. He... knows things. Things they want to know too. || [context] NodeContext: Hesitant to say exactly what Wulbren knows
Barcus Wroot: What has he gotten himself mixed up in now...
Player: Before you ask, no - I'm not going to stage a rescue.
Beldron: Aye. Nor us, I'm afraid. || [context] NodeContext: shrugging, a little defeated. This line trails off into another 'Much as I want to march after Wulbren myself... we can't.'
Beldron: We have our own freedom to look to, I'm afraid. We'll take our chance when it arises, then back to the city. || [context] NodeContext: His people are still enslaved - he needs to be pragmatic.

----- Session: DwarvenAlchemist -----
Synopsis: Derryth is a dwarven alchemist visiting the underdark from Baldur's Gate. She runs a shop in the city with Baelen, her business partner. They've come to the underdark in search of a very valuable mushroom - noblestalk. When the player arrived, she was tending to an injured gnome.
Derryth is a bit gruff - she's a healer, but her bedside manner leaves a lot to be desired. She's also a very shrewd businessperson. She's in the underdark to get rich first and foremost.
She treats her business partner (Baelen) like he's an idiot, and pretends not to care about him, but in reality he is the most important person to her in the world.

Derryth Bonecloak: You don't know what you've done. Leave me be. || [context] NodeContext: Player cured Baelen. She's facing a terrible future.
Player: I know exactly what I've done. Very entertaining. || [approval] ['Wyll -1', 'Karlach -1']
Derryth Bonecloak: You're a beast - you and Baelen  would make fine bedfellows.
Derryth Bonecloak: Get out of my face. Find some else's suffering to lap up.

----- Session: AD_CheckpointGuard_002_Combat -----
Synopsis: One-shot combat AD to play when the myconid is taking their turn.

Restless Myconid: ((*the disease still festers. I will cut it out*))

----- Session: CheckpointGuard_001 -----
Synopsis: Individual myconid responds with one-liner after you have gained access to the myconid circle. Hallucinogenic delivery.

Narrator: *The creature's song rumbles within you, neither warm nor welcoming.*

----- Session: VB_GlutDead_1P -----
Synopsis: Players refuse to kill Sovereign Spawn on Sovereign Glut's behalf. Glut has attacked the players and is now dead. The party comments afterwards.

Player: The usurper is dead. So much for 'Circle Glut'.

----- Session: CheckpointGuard_000 -----
Synopsis: You come upon the myconid guards. They warn the sovereign of your presence telepathically, and it begins to speak to you. This should be creepy, hallucinatory.

Narrator: *You are swallowed by a chorus of turbulent music. Through one creature sing many voices: the harmony of an entire collective.*
Restless Myconid: ((*Sovereign. they have come. they are here*))
Narrator: *The choir fades. A single melody rises above the others, brassy and commanding.*
: ((*I am Sovereign*))
Narrator: *You see a vision: your lifeless body, wrapped in fungal tendrils. The sovereign is threatening you.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Player closes eyes as if seeing the vision in their head.
: ((*state your purpose*))
Player: I am a traveller seeking adventure. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Player closes eyes.
: True
Narrator: *Fungal roots weave through your mind, seeking your true intent.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Player closes eyes as if to see the vision. || [approval] ['Gale 1', 'Shadowheart 1', 'Wyll 1', 'Karlach 1']
Narrator: *Then the sovereign drones a new melody, cautious but welcoming.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Overhead view, as sovereign is not in sight range.
: ((*descend to me. let us speak in flesh*)) || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Overhead view, as sovereign is not in sight range. (Custom cameras required)
Narrator: *The persistent music coaxes you forward. The sovereign expects you.*

----- Session: DeepRothe -----
Synopsis: A Deep Rothe that belongs to Derryth and Baelen Bonecloak. A beast of burden with a simple Speak with Animals dialogue. There's some reactivity depending on whether Baelen has returned to the bonecloak camp or not, and if Baelen recovered his senses by eating the noblestalk mushroom. The animal's observations reinforce that Baelen has been more amiable and gentle since his mind began to slip, and his recovery is not seen as a good thing by all.

Deep Rothé: Master sounds different, like old self. Angry self. Don't like. || [context] NodeContext: SWA line. Reproachful. A simple beast of burden senses his master has returned to a crueler demeanour.

----- Session: AD_CheckpointGuard_004_Combat -----
Synopsis: One-shot combat AD to play when the myconid is taking their turn.

Noxious Myconid: ((*you will fall. and in death, we will raise you*))

----- Session: SocietyOfBrilliance_Scholar -----

He talks about his research and, if the tadpole is mentioned, brings his mind flayer friend Omeluum to talk to the player. The player can either agree to the mind flayer's help or attack.

Blurg: I must complete this study. Entertain yourself elsewhere.

----- Session: AD_Myconid_004_Combat -----
Synopsis: One-shot combat AD to play when the myconid is taking their turn.

Noxious Myconid: ((*defend the circle. stop the decay*))

Restless Myconid: ((*intruder. interloper. invader*))

----- Session: ServantHookHorror_01 -----
Synopsis: You interact with a hook horror servant belonging to the myconids.

Narrator: *The monstrosity stares blankly forward.*

----- Session: BroodingSovereign -----
Synopsis: A sovereign myconid we call the brooding sovereign has been displaced to this myconid circle, after the duergar attackes his home. He would like to join you as you cleanse the area of duergar as a means of getting revenge - supposedly.

 The top block: The borroding myconid is with the other myconids. You can recruit it.

The middle block: You have killed the lone duergar. the myconid now wants you to kill all the duergars.

 Next block: you have killed all the duergars; now it wants you to kill the sovereign
. 
Final block: you have killed the sovereign and it rewards you. 

This myconid does not speak with the same hive mind voice of the others. He should sound creepy, like FART in Rick and Morty, with a SLIGHT undercurrent of menace.

 As the quest moves on, he gets more and more creepy and angry,

Sovereign Glut: ((*the tumour is excised. the duergar are dead*))
Sovereign Glut: ((*here, I break ground. from the dark will a mighty Circle rise. my song will fill the Grotto!*))
Sovereign Glut: ((*death-doer - the Grotto may sustain but one Sovereign. in the Age of Glut...*))
Sovereign Glut: ((*...there may be no Spaw. eliminate the other Sovereign*))
Player: If you're so eager for blood, Glut, then let me give it to you. || [approval] ['Astarion 1', "Lae'zel 1", 'Wyll 1']
Sovereign Glut: ((*you shall never again know home*))

----- Session: CheckpointGuard_004 -----
Synopsis: Individual myconid responds with one-liner after you have gained access to the myconid circle. Hallucinogenic delivery.

Noxious Myconid: ((*no peace*))

----- Session: ServantDuergar1 -----
Synopsis: Player tries speaking with an enthralled duergar. Duergar players get an option to go hostile afterwards.

Narrator: *Fungus and mould glaze the servant's face and body. Through music and vision, the sovereign reveals its origins.*
Narrator: *You see a frothing duergar, axe drawn, crazed by bloodlust, bearing down on a young myconid.*
Narrator: *The frightened myconid circle conjures mildewed vines. They encircle and transform the duergar.*
Narrator: *It now belongs to the circle. It will obey the sovereign.*
Player: Leave.

----- Session: AD_CheckpointGuard_003_Combat -----
Synopsis: One-shot combat AD to play when the myconid is taking their turn.

Hasmet: Occurs second time, regardless of how mnay players are in party. Player hears a strange voice, and has a reaction to it. Second time: Tries to respond to it.

: ((*more are coming*))
Narrator: *Your mind is a canyon, and the words echo from every crevasse.*
: ((*they're coming. they're coming*))

: ((*they're coming. you're coming*))<br>

----- Session: AD_Myconid_005_Combat -----
Synopsis: One-shot combat AD to play when the myconid is taking their turn.

Mossy Myconid: ((*cut the blight away. watch it wither*))

----- Session: DeadMyconid_Dead -----
Synopsis: Speak with dead on Myconid sprout. Sprouts are children. This one should sound young. It describes being killed by grey dwarves (duergar). Should not sound like hivemind.

Narrator: *The corpse twitches in response to the spell...*
: False
Narrator: *...and awaits your first question.*
Player: What was your role in the circle?
Narrator: *Like its living counterparts, the corpse speaks in your mind.*
Dead Myconid Sprout: ((*...to grow. to know. to be one with the Circle...*))

----- Session: MushroomField_Warning -----
Synopsis: Myconid warns you that mushrooms explode if you get too close.

Restless Myconid: ((*after the light comes the bang. step away. step away*))

----- Session: InjuredGnome_SporeServant -----
Synopsis: Player speaks with Thulla - the injured gnome, - after she dies from duergar poison and is resurrected by the myconids as a spore servant.

Narrator: *It is not a gnome who stands before you, but a mere husk.*
Narrator: *It stands quietly, awaiting its myconid master's command.*

----- Session: SocietyOfBrilliance_MindFlayer -----
Synopsis: Omeluum is a friendly, neutral mind flayer and member of the Society of Brilliance, dedicated to improving life in the Underdark. If attacked, it will teleport away rather than engaging in combat.

Omeluum: I greet you, sun child.
Player: I'd like to learn more about the tadpole.<br> || [approval] ['Karlach 1']
Narrator: *An almost childlike joy enters Omeluum's ichor-laced eyes.*
Omeluum: Open your mind to me, friend. Let us see what lurks within.
Player: Never mind. I'm done with mind flayers touching me.
Omeluum: I see. I will remain here if you decide otherwise.

----- Session: DirectToSovereign_HookHorror -----
Synopsis: If you speak to a myconid after the guards speak to you but you have not yet spoken to the sovereign, his voice will speak through them.

Narrator: *The monstrosity stares blankly. The voice that echoes within you belongs not to it, but the sovereign.*
: ((*leave this one. come to me. we must speak*))

--- Scenario Details ---
======== Scenario: for_kidsgame ========
Session Sequence: 
======== Scenario: for_deathofatruesoul ========
Session Sequence: PAD_TadpoleLeaves
----- Session: PAD_TadpoleLeaves -----
Synopsis: The players reflect on having just witnessed a tadpole emerge from the corpse of a recently deceased Absolute cultist. They consider the creature that's been causing each of them so much trouble. Despair or determination.This happens at the end of a scene and the characters are interchangeable here. They can all be opinionated.

Player: These things abandon their hosts as soon as they need to. Vile parasites...
Player: The longer we wait, the likelier that we share in this fate, or worse. Let's get rid of these things.

======== Scenario: for_bottomlesswell ========
Session Sequence: VB_EnterNest
----- Session: VB_EnterNest -----
Synopsis: The player sees the gigantic spider in the spider nest.

Player: Oh, hells.

======== Scenario: for_weakbridge ========
Session Sequence: 
======== Scenario: for_owlbear ========
Session Sequence: PAD_HealedOwlbear -> VB_CubResolution_2P -> VB_CubResolution_1P -> CMB_Enrage -> VB_LastCub
----- Session: PAD_HealedOwlbear -----
Synopsis: A short VB after player heals the Owlbear in gameplay. Owlbear is still dangerous, though. This can happen either before or after the player has interacted with Owlbear. It's meant to give feedback on the fact that the owlbear is now healed, but not to encourage the player to provoke her.

Player: Healed - but she doesn't look much happier. || [context] NodeContext: Karlach: 'I healed you, owlbear--> you still look like you're gonna rip my face off.'

----- Session: VB_CubResolution_2P -----
Synopsis: The party briefly reflects on their decision to spare or kill an orphaned owlbear cub.

Player: At least the cub has a fighting chance now. || [context] NodeContext: Reasoning; justifying decision to let an orphaned animal cub live.
Player: That, or we've just prolonged its misery. || [context] NodeContext: Unconvinced. Wondering if it would've been better to kill the animal.

----- Session: VB_CubResolution_1P -----
Synopsis: The players comment briefly on their decision to let an orphaned owlbear cub live or not.

Player: Nature can provide for the cub. Perhaps it'll live. || [context] NodeContext: Reasoning decision to let an orphaned owlbear cub fend for itself.

----- Session: CMB_Enrage -----
Synopsis: In SwA, the owlbear speaks like a human. Her voice is deep and threatening - in this dialogue specifically, she is enraged.Players encounter an owlbear mother and her cub in a cave. This dialogue plays if players smash her egg or kill her cub in front of her.

Owlbear: NO! WHAT DID YOU DO? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Charges to attack.NodeContext: Horrified and enraged

----- Session: VB_LastCub -----
Synopsis: After killing an adult owlbear, combat ends as the player notes that the surviving owlbear cub doesn't pose much of a threat to them.

Player: A lone cub isn't much of a threat...
Player: Not without its mother by its side. What now?

======== Scenario: for_gnomegoblin1 ========
Session Sequence:  -> AD_InvestigateMill -> Dead
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: The party comes across a trio of goblins who've captured a gnome and have turned to tormenting him - they've tied him to a windmill and are watching him spin around. The party can try to intervene and save the gnome, possibly using a cult symbol of authority as a way to convince the goblins, if they have it. FOR_GnomeGoblin_1 (Fezzerk) is the leader of the goblins and does most of the talking. If the player is a drow, the goblins will be much more nervous and easier to intimidate. At times, the captive goblin pipes up from the windmill, loudly pleading or berating his captors.

Fezzerk: Look what we got here - another little birdie wantin' to fly! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Cinematic/look-at context - Fezzerk notices us and calls out to his cronies. (The line is addressed to the goblin raider and scavenger, but Fezzerk's attention is broadly held by the player.NodeContext: Cruel bravado.The goblin sees the player approach and boldly announces it to his cronies - he thinks some fresh victims have just turned up.
Fezzerk: Yehehueh! Flap those wings some more, an' I'll feed you a worm! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Cinematic/look-at context - Fezzerk calls out to taunt his deep gnome prisoner, who rotates on the sail of a windmill a short-moderate distance off.NodeContext: Greatly amused. A schoolyard bully tormenting the little kid. Projecting his voice a little (Fezzerk calls out to taunt his deep gnome prisoner, who rotates on the sail of a windmill a short-moderate distance off.)
'Yehehueh!' = Fezzerk's distinct laugh (a raspy, mean-spirited slur of a laugh)
Fezzerk: An' you - hope you got a stomach fer heights! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The goblin turns back to the player (if the gnome inclusion line triggered - otherwise he's facing the player the whole time.)NodeContext: Confident, unpleasant. Turning his attention to the player to deliver a threat.
Player: I'm not looking for trouble - just want to pass by.
Fezzerk: Heh, funny. That's what our birdie wanted. || [context] NodeContext: Mocking. Refers to the player's previous statement ('I don't want trouble - just want to pass by').
Barcus Wroot: ...Release me this instant, you beasts! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Context - the deep gnome yells at his captors as he swings into earshotNodeContext: Panicked, angry. Issuing an ultimatum even though he has no means of following through on it.
Fezzerk: 'Less you wanna join him up there, you'd best pay the toll. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The lead goblin looks at his hands and tries to calculate a figure with his fingers.NodeContext: Fezzerk mockingly refers to the deep gnome's predicament as he threatens the player. 'Passing by' refers to rotating on a windmill rather than safe passage through the area, in his book.
Fezzerk: Cough it up! ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54]) || [context] InternalNodeContext: The idea is the goblin is a bit dim greedy and throwing out a stupidly high number.NodeContext: Fezzerk declares his price. (A ridiculously high sum - questionable whether he truly knows how absurd a demand this is)
Narrator: *A strange symbol glows, marked on their flesh, and something within you stirs in response.*

Ellyka: Those things you're masquerading as. Armed to the teeth. And they've a dragon.
Ellyka: I was counting on crossing that bridge and heading to Baldur's Gate. To safety.
Ellyka: Now I've got to find another way around. Take your chances against that lot if you like.

Player: Seems you have good survival instincts - maybe you should join me instead.
Ellyka: What? Just follow you around?
Ellyka: I go my own way. Alone.

----- Session: PAD_LaezelKilledByGith -----
Synopsis: Player returning to the Gith Chokepoint area after leaving Lae'zel behind -- she has been killed by the gith

Player: Dead - by her own kin's hand.
Player: Come - we shouldn't linger here.

----- Session: CINE_RiderAndDragonLeave -----
Synopsis: Cinematic: Kith'rak Voss flies away on his dragon.The player interrupted the Gith Chokepoint situation. The most likely interruption is triggering a combat (player attacks any npc there including Voss or the dragon, or drags another hostile npc near them)This interruption happens in gameplay, so normally the Rider (Kith'rak Voss) and the Dragon would also leave in gameplay, but animations don't have the tech support to make the Rider ride the dragon like this, so we play this cutscene instead

[desc] CinematicNodeContext: ~The dragon spreads its wings and soars away.
NOTE: this could be used in a number of circumstances in which Voss flies away. Voss is an arrogant senior gith officer, focused on his mission, so he can always depart while being unfazed by preceeding events. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: ~The dragon spreads its wings and soars away.

Kith'rak Voss: You are unknown to me, kin. Are you straight from the crèche, wandering unbidden? || [context] InternalNodeContext: Do not put a selection speaker here, gith has priority

----- Session: AD_StandOff -----
Synopsis: A flaming fist solider nervously attempts to challenge a githyanki warrior. The gith is essentially an alien to the lowly soldier; he can't help but feel intimidated.

Once outside, Benryn is in shock at the carnage around him - bodies of goblins and humans litter the inn's courtyard. He snaps out of his shock when he thinks of his wife, who was outside when the raiding party arrived. He pleads for the player to help him find her - when players do, she is already dead. Pointed to her body, Benryn breaks down - the weight of guilt immediately crushing him.

Benryn: Miri, no... gods, no, no, no!
Benryn: You should've stayed... you should've been with me. || [context] NodeContext: Speaking to his dead wife's body.
Player: How did you two get separated?
Benryn: I was in our room. We had a fight.
Benryn: If I'd just kept my mouth shut about that bloody dowry, she'd... she'd still be here. || [context] NodeContext: He's explaining a stupid argument he and his wife had that led to her storming outside, where she was killed by goblins.
Player: This isn't on you. There was no way you could have known.
Benryn: I'm sorry, Miri. I'm so sorry.
Benryn: Please, just go. I need a moment with her.

----- Session: AD_FoundWife -----
Synopsis: Benryn has been freed from a burning inn after becoming trapped during a drow/goblin attack. He's just found his wife's body. He'd been holding out hope that she was still alive.

Benryn: Oh, Miri... No... || [context] NodeContext: Benryn has found his wife's body. He's absolutely devastated - he was afraid she had been killed, but he was holding out hope.

----- Session: AD_ToWife -----
Synopsis: This AD plays after the player has told Benryn where he can find his wife's body. He doesn't want to believe it, but he knows it is probably true. If the corpse has been moved after players tell him where he can find her, he has a spark of hope - she's not there, so perhaps she is still alive after all.

Benryn: She's not here. Maybe she's all right. || [context] NodeContext: Hopeful, but not entierly convinced.

----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Salazon is preparing a fire-trap at the entrance to his gang's hideout. We can either sneak up on him or be sneaked up on in turn - either way we have to convince him we should be there or he'll get skittish and blow us all up. In general he's jumpy and suspicious of us, but relieved when we convince him we're a friend. Think an inexperienced guard pointing a gun at us when he's been told to be on alert.

Narrator: *A human man awaits you, a spell crackling at his fingertips.* || [context] NodeContext: [Salazon is crouching behind the shelves with Fire Bolt ready].
