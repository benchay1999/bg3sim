If Shadowheart is present, she'll warn the player to not trust Lae'zel (she doesn't trust gith due to previous experiences while on a secret mission against them, but doesn't elaborate).

Damays: Zorru was right. Yellow as a toad, and twice as ugly. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Custom scene viewer/cameras for cage shots.

Player: This creature is dangerous. Get out of here - leave it to me!
: True
Damays: They're right. No one's safe if that thing goes loose. || [approval] ["Lae'zel 1", 'Gale 1', 'Wyll 1', 'Karlach 1']

In this state, Tahani isn't convinced the threat is really over. She thinks her fellow druids will lead them down the same path again, taking pity on people that will only bring trouble to their door.The player always encounters Inwe around a sacred druid pool.

Topaz: *Screech!* || [context] InternalNodeContext: Custom crime reaction exclusive to the blue jay in this booster

======== Scenario: den_tieflingscam ========
Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Nerela is wondering whether to sell a music box, the only memento she has of the husband and daughter who were killed by gnolls on the road here. It's a scam - her story is fabricated and the box is a dime a dozen. Player can comfort her or see through her story. Her overall demeanour is weary, fragile (unless you uncover her scam)

Player: |Cinematic: The woman cradled a carved wooden box, from which a soft melody chimed.| || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Lost in thought, holding the box as it's the most precious thing in the world.NodeContext: Sitting
Player: What are you doing?
Nerela: Oh! Sorry, I'm just... I'm just listening. || [context] NodeContext: Starting out of a reverie - suddenly embarrassed
Nerela: I used to hate this tune - told my husband as much when he made the bloody thing. || [context] NodeContext: Laughing, self-deprecating, self-conscious
Nerela: But it kept our little monster quiet. Reason to love it if nothing else, trust me. || [context] NodeContext: A tired and exasperated parent, remembering.
Nerela: ... how much do you think it's worth? Old Ethel said she'd offer me gold for it. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: She closes the box and plays her fingers along the lid. Abruptly, she offers it up.NodeContext: Hesitant and suddenly serious, intent on  your response
Player: Why do you want to sell it?
Nerela: I... don't have anything else. My husband was carrying our packs when the gnolls found us. || [context] NodeContext: A little lost. Remembering something painful.
Nerela: My daughter, sh-she thought they were just big dogs. I tried to get to her... I tried, but- || [context] NodeContext: Breaking up towards end of sentence, grieving
Nerela: You must - you must think I'm a monster.  But they say you need coin to enter the city. Bribes. || [context] NodeContext: Approaching hysteria, doesn't know what to do
Player: You're no monster. I'm sorry you had to go through that.
Nerela: You're kind, but I - I can't think about that now. We promised one another we'd get there, whatever it took. || [context] NodeContext: Waving off your sympathy - she's barely holding it together as it is.
Nerela: If we... if I don't, it... then they'll have died for nothing. || [context] NodeContext: Knows it's not logical, but can't dwell on tragedy or she'll break down

======== Scenario: den_tieflingleader ========
Session Sequence: AD_Victory -> HeadedToCave -> AD_WithGuard -> PAD_ZevlorsMap
----- Session: AD_Victory -----
Synopsis: Plays after the tieflings won Attack on Den or after completing Goblin Hunt. Zevlor is standing on the plateform above the gate of the Grove and he's watching the other tieflings below.

Zevlor: Grab your bags. We're moving! || [context] NodeContext: Announcing to everyone it's time to leave. Eager, putting on a brave face.

----- Session: HeadedToCave -----
Synopsis: |Zevlor's default dialog need a timeline context, so this dialog here is used as a transition when Zevlor is walking back to his default spot after a big event happened in the Grove. There's 2 cases: after the raiding party and after druid attack.|

Zevlor: Hm? Come introduce yourself in the caves. I need to get people moving. || [context] InternalNodeContext: The player can avoid DenIntro by progressing into the caves without talking to Zevlor

----- Session: AD_WithGuard -----
Synopsis: Zevlor and Tilses are chatting together in his sub-region. Zevlor is worrying over plans for the future while Tilses stands ready to help.

Zevlor: I hardly need a bodyguard, Tilses. This isn't Avernus. || [context] NodeContext: Wry - they're civilians but his former lieutenant is sticking to him like glue. [TIL-sez]
Tilses: No sir. At least the monsters there looked like monsters. || [context] NodeContext: Unperturbed, matter of fact - she doesn't trust the druids around them

----- Session: PAD_ZevlorsMap -----
Synopsis: |Player clicked on Zevlor's map (a map of Elturgard that shows the road to Baldur's Gate). Zevlor will likely have drawn on it.|

Player: Looks like we're in Elturgard. East of the city of Baldur's Gate.

======== Scenario: den_prodigy ========
Session Sequence: Group -> AD ->  -> Sister -> Brother
----- Session: Group -----
Synopsis: Three people are having an argument. Rolan, Lia and Cal. Lia and Cal are brother and sister, but the three of them have grown up together. They're young, talented tieflings who are heading to Baldur's Gate to start their lives and careers. Rolan argues that they should leave now and get to the city while they still can. Lia argues that it is irresponsible to leave their kin behind. Cal is stuck in the middle.
This is a passionate and fiery argument, both sides are convinced that they are correct.

Lia: Hells, we can't just leave. They're kin. || [context] NodeContext: This is the start of the dialog but clearly an ongoing argument. You think it's your responsibility, as a tiefling, to stay and help your kin. You're angry, voice is level but will soon grow louder, and utterly convinced that staying at the camp is the right thing to do.
Rolan: I'll not gamble our lives, our futures, on people who are as good as dead. We must leave for Baldur's Gate - at once. || [context] NodeContext: You're angry but your voice is level. You think staying at the camp is essentially suicide. You cannot believe it was even suggested. You and your friends have brand new lives waiting for you in Baldur's Gate - to stay at the camp is reckless and pointless to you.
Cal: Can we all just take a moment? Please? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Looking for one to the other. Stuck in between them, pleading. Hands out as he tries to calm the situation. NodeContext: Your friend and sister are screaming at each other in front of you. Light and easygoing tone as you try to calm the argument.
Lia: What's the point in blades and spells if we don't bloody use them? We should stay. || [context] NodeContext: Your voice is getting louder. You're very angry now. It's your civic duty to use the skills you have to help people. You cannot believe how selfish Rolan is being.
Lia: These people aren't fighters. We can help. || [context] NodeContext: Ibid.
Cal: Or yell louder. That's fine too. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Sighing as he shrugs. He knows neither is listening to him. NodeContext: Your friend and sister have ignored your plea. You know once they've started they'll just keep arguing until one of them gives in. This is almost said with a shrug and in a light, jokey tone.
Player: You should all stay. A single blade could make a difference. || [approval] ['Gale 1', 'Karlach 1']
: False
Rolan: No. This place is a death trap. Let us leave - immediately! || [context] NodeContext: Player has disagreed with you. You're frustrated and angry. You think it's ludicrous that anyone would disagree with you.
Rolan: Or would you deny your brother here his chance at fortune in Baldur's Gate? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Looking at Lia but gesturing to Cal. NodeContext: You know the argument is likely going your way and you're being a little bit of a dick here. You know mentioning Lia's brother is a guarantee that she'll give in to your side and leave with you. It's a bit of an underhanded move.
Player: You want fortune? There's coin in it if you stay.
Lia: You know, that money could go towards a spiffy new outfit for your apprenticeship...? || [context] NodeContext: Smile, knowing rolan will give in
Rolan: Zurgan. Fine. Give it here. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Generic 'taking' animation. Taking coin from the player.NodeContext: 'ZUR-gan.' Frustrated but giving in to the promise of going.
Rolan: If we survive, it'll make for a good story I suppose... || [context] NodeContext: Kinda sulky but accepting that you'll stay in the grove.
Lia: Thank you, Rolan. And thank you, friend. || [context] NodeContext: Warm and sincere. Directed at rolan and then player.

----- Session: AD -----
Synopsis: This occurs betwen Lia, Cal and Ronan. There are mixed ADs which occur - when they're arguing about when to stay and go, when they've decided to stay and when they've decided to go.

Rolan: We don't even know these people! || [context] NodeContext: Arguing with Lia. He thinks her suggestion to stay is suicide.
Lia: That doesn't matter. || [context] NodeContext: Rolan has claimed you don't even know the other tieflings. You're snapping back.
Rolan: Of course it does. You would choose strangers over us!
Lia: That's not what I said.
Cal: Can we stop shouting? No? || [context] NodeContext: You sister and your best friend are arguing and it's getting progressively heated. You're trying to calm the situation but you also know they're going to keep ignoring you.

----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: This occurs after the argument with Lia. If they're leaving for Baldur's Gate he's pretty relaxed about the argument and dismissive of Lia and her concerns. If they're staying in the grove, he's furious and is convinced they'll die here.

Rolan: I can spare but a moment - Baldur's Gate awaits! Oh, I can almost smell the city. || [context] NodeContext: Leaving for Baldur's Gate after a hell of an argument but isn't bothered. Excited to be leaving and seems oblvious to that fact that Lia is next to him, SEETHING.
Player: You're cheerful for someone about to abandon his kin. || [approval] ['Gale 1']
Rolan: Well, you're here, aren't you? You can help them if you want.
Rolan: I don't believe in sacrifices for a lost cause.
Rolan: We're leaving for Baldur's Gate. And we will make it.
Player: Are you always this selfish?
Rolan: Tch. You're as bad as Lia.
Rolan: And I think one of her is quite enough in my life. Good day to you.

----- Session: Sister -----
Synopsis: This occurs after the argument betwen Lia and Rolan. Lia is still stewing after the fight. Opportunity to get to know her better and understand the group dynamics.

Lia: Those goblins will rue the day they chose to tangle with this grove.
Lia: You and I will do some good here - I can feel it.

----- Session: Brother -----
Synopsis: This dialog occurs after the argument between Lia and Rolan that Cal attempted to mediate. It's light and friendly, and mainly a chance for the player to get to know Cal.

Cal: Lia and Rolan would never admit it, but they'd take an arrow for the other. Also stab each other. Not sure what'll come first. || [context] NodeContext: You have broken up a fight between Lia and Rolan more times than you can count. You're tone is light and friendly as you joke with the player.
Cal: Thanks for cutting in - there might have been more than words if you hadn't. || [context] NodeContext: A big friendly smile - you are the most genuine of the group

======== Scenario: den_adventurersquest ========
Session Sequence: RobbedAdventurerAtCorpses -> RaidAdventurer -> LeaderAtCorpses -> AD_RemiraBarthAtCorpses -> AD_AradinAndRemira
----- Session: RobbedAdventurerAtCorpses -----
Synopsis: The adventurer is standing next to the corpses of her comrades he left behind while running for the goblins.

Barth: Damn it. I wish we could at least give them a proper burial.

----- Session: RaidAdventurer -----
Synopsis: Age: mid-30-40s.
Female
Bio: Rough and working-class. A veteran of many expeditions, Remira is nonetheless shaken after a raid gone horribly wrong and trying to hide it behind bravado. She feels guilty for leaving a new recruit to die, but tries to wave it away and gets defensive if confronted over it. She’s sarcastic and casually racist.

Remira: Once we're patched up, we're gone.

----- Session: LeaderAtCorpses -----
Synopsis: Aradin comes across the corpses of some of his friends, who were lost during the goblin raid. He's in a neutral location at a bridge and observing the corpses of his people and of goblins, who were also killed in the fight.

Aradin: Thought you was busy with the foulbloods in Halsin's grove.

----- Session: AD_RemiraBarthAtCorpses -----
Synopsis: Remira and Aradin are discussing the fate of their fallen comrades at the hands of goblins

Remira: Liam isn't here...
Barth: He didn't make it this far. You saw them grab him.
Remira: You don't gotta remind me.

----- Session: AD_AradinAndRemira -----
Synopsis: Aradin and Remira are having a drink after arriving back in the Druid Grove.

Remira: You shouldn't have brought Liam along. Lad was too young.
Aradin: Everyone needs to cut their teeth sometime.
Remira: Cut his teeth?! For his sake, I hope he's dead already.

======== Scenario: den_adventurerleader ========
Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Adventurer leader dialogue. Mostly used during Adventurers Quest. This is after the player has stopped Zevlor and Aradin from fighting one another. Aradin returns to his den to lick his wounds.

Aradin: If it ain't the fearless goblin-slayer. || [context] NodeContext: Aggressive, but not powerfully so. He's not a friendly guy.
Aradin: You sure you want to be seen with me? I ain't exactly popular with this lot. || [context] NodeContext: with a grimace - 'this lot' refers specifically to the tiefling refugees who are nearby but not necessarily in-shot, but he's grumpy enough that it also refers to just about everybody in the world
Player: You could try to be a little friendlier.
Aradin: Thanks, mum. Now please do feck off. || [context] NodeContext: Thick with sarcasm
Player: Feck off yourself - I saved your skin back at the gates.
Aradin: Yeah, you really saved the day, swooping in and playing the hero. || [context] NodeContext: Sarcastic and punchable
Aradin: Now I'm gonna take the blame for leading the goblins here, and losing track of the bloody druid. || [context] NodeContext: He knows these things are his fault, but he's sulking and petulant about it
Player: Where did the goblins come from?
Aradin: They chased us all the way from the ruins we were poking around in.
Player: Sounds like you were looking for trouble.
Aradin: We was looking for a relic. Had a contract to find it, and the fella who runs this place came along on the job with us. || [context] NodeContext: petulant
Aradin: Didn't work out, though. Goblins got him when we were turning tail. He's either diggin' latrines or boilin' in a cookpot by now.
Player: Did you think getting rich would be easy?
Aradin: Dunno what I expected. That much gold for some long-lost relic. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])
Aradin: And from a wizard, too. I shoulda known. The gold probably turns to lead the moment you leave Baldur's Gate.
Aradin: Stupid thing to die for... || [context] NodeContext: Dismissive
Aradin: But gold ain't any use if you're too cold to spend it. || [context] NodeContext: Flippant
Player: Just tell me where to find the relic.
Aradin: It's called the Nightsong. Supposed to be hidden under the temple where the goblins jumped us.
Aradin: I'd give you the map and wish you a happy funeral, but my mate Brian kept hold of it like his own todger. Goblins made short of the fat old chunk. || [context] NodeContext: Disrespectful

Fezzerk: K-keep him spinning! Make that birdie chirp! || [context] NodeContext: Fezzerk continues to taunt the captive gnome, but is now nervous and self-conscious due to the observing drow player. It's like his boss is breathing down his neck.

Once outside, Benryn is in shock at the carnage around him - bodies of goblins and humans litter the inn's courtyard. He snaps out of his shock when he thinks of his wife, who was outside when the raiding party arrived. He pleads for the player to help him find her - when players do, she is already dead. Pointed to her body, Benryn breaks down - the weight of guilt immediately crushing him.The barbarian class will have advantage in a strength check to lift the wreckage off Benryn, however if they fail, they can try again with a higher DC.

Normally, these monsters hunger for flesh and eat anything, but the flind has been infected with a mind flayer's tadpole (like the players) and this has created an internal 'Voice' that guides it toward certain meat, forbidding others. The forbidden meats are those that work for the mind flayers - including the players - leading to a telepathic 'dialogue' when the flind restrains itself from attacking and calls off its pack.

We can attempt to overpower the Flind psionically, allowing us to control it temporarily in order to destroy the pack of gnolls. If we choose to fight the Flind, we should be prepared for a difficult encounter. It is strong, though far from the most powerful of its kind thanks to the war raging in its brain.

----- Session: CINE_RiderAndDragonLeave -----
Synopsis: Cinematic: Kith'rak Voss flies away on his dragon.The player interrupted the Gith Chokepoint situation. The most likely interruption is triggering a combat (player attacks any npc there including Voss or the dragon, or drags another hostile npc near them)This interruption happens in gameplay, so normally the Rider (Kith'rak Voss) and the Dragon would also leave in gameplay, but animations don't have the tech support to make the Rider ride the dragon like this, so we play this cutscene instead

[desc] CinematicNodeContext: ~The dragon spreads its wings and soars away.
NOTE: this could be used in a number of circumstances in which Voss flies away. Voss is an arrogant senior gith officer, focused on his mission, so he can always depart while being unfazed by preceeding events. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: ~The dragon spreads its wings and soars away.

======== Scenario: hag_swampexploration ========
Session Sequence: PAD_PrickedFinger
----- Session: PAD_PrickedFinger -----
Synopsis: The player has pricked their finger on a thorny bush. The player encounters a thorny bush full of fruit. In order to take the fruit from the bush without cutting theirself, the player must pass a Sleight of Hand test.

Karlach: 'Fing' is on purpose

======== Scenario: hag_hagamush ========
Session Sequence: PAD_FoundBrothersAfterLongRest
----- Session: PAD_FoundBrothersAfterLongRest -----
Synopsis: This occurs after the player has refused to help the brothers and subsequently finds them dead/one of them dead. It can trigger in the swamp, teahouse or lair, and you may not know that Ethel is a hag at this point (depending on where it triggers). In the first, you've met the brothers, in the second you skipped the confrontation and have no idea who these men are.

Player: Be ready. Whoever - or whatever - did this could be close.

======== Scenario: hag_murderousfrog ========
Session Sequence: 
======== Scenario: hag_forestillusion ========
Session Sequence: IllusionRedcap
----- Session: IllusionRedcap -----
Synopsis: This occurs in the swamp. Sheep wander the area - except they're redcaps (a type of violent faerie) hidden by the hag's illusions. The creatures are pretending to be sheep. 
The illusion can be shattered by an animal handling check. OR if the player preciously succeeded in a perception check in the area.

Redcap Blood Sage, Redcap, Redcap Blood Sage, 0446e7c4-3076-415c-aa7f-deb7f43e5d06, Redcap, a72e6051-d06b-469c-b6dc-4c962cfe307f: Baaa. Argh. BAAA. || [context] NodeContext: Redcap pretending to be a sheep, isn't very good at the impression.

======== Scenario: hag_hagambush ========
Session Sequence: Brother_002_AD_Fallback -> AD_HagDisappear -> AD_Argument -> Brother_002_AD_BrotherDied -> AD_HagThankPlayer -> Confrontation
----- Session: Brother_002_AD_Fallback -----
Synopsis: Player tries to speak to the brother while either the other brother is in the shared Brothers dialogue (and this one missed it for some reason), or because they're waiting for the hag to come back into the house and start her dialogue.

Johl: Hold on. || [context] NodeContext: You're in the swamp and want to keep moving. Gruff and impatient.

----- Session: AD_HagDisappear -----
Synopsis: AD that fires as the Hag disappears during the ambush.

: Bye-bye, my lovelies! || [context] NodeContext: You've disappeared into thin air. A mocking goodbye.

----- Session: AD_Argument -----
Synopsis: This argument is the beginning of the situation. The three of them are yelling at each other out in the open. The brothers believe Ethel has taken their sister, while she is denying any knowledge of the girl.

: You're both this close to getting a slap. || [context] NodeContext: Annoyed and unimpressed. You're having none of these brothers  and they're starting to piss you off.
Johl: Enough. We know you have her. || [context] NodeContext: You're getting tired of Ethel - and trying to sound threatening.
Demir: Please, we just want Mayrina back. || [context] NodeContext: Trying to calm the situation - you don't want it to get violent and you're also terrified of Ethel/

----- Session: Brother_002_AD_BrotherDied -----
Synopsis: Occurs when Johl's brother dies.

Johl: Demir! DEMIR! || [context] NodeContext: Your brother has died in front of you.

----- Session: AD_HagThankPlayer -----

----- Session: PAD_SidedHag -----
Synopsis: This VB plays after saving Ethel from the two brothers of the sister she's holding captive. Ether disappeared in a magic puff, and she was acting suspicious. The players are reacting to her exit and discussing that there may be more to Ethel than meets the eye.Speaker 1 may have been the character who was in dialog for the scene with Ethel. Speaker 2 is another party member. However, since there may be combat, this setup isn't guaranteed and it's best to write this assuming everyone had a hand in the actions that led to this VB playing.

Player: Bloody way to end an argument. I hope we chose the right side.
Player: No point in debating what's already done. Let's go on ahead.

Player: Let's hope it doesn't come back to bite me later.

Volo: We mustn't tarry, but I'd hate for our friendship to end here. Please - won't you meet me, once we've both slipped the goblin yoke?
Player: A fine mess you landed yourself in. How'd you get caught?
Volo: Why, by design, my friend. How better to learn the ways of a people than to live among them?
Volo: I daresay the experiment has proven most fruitful, too. I'll be happy to share my findings... once we've found somewhere safe to parley.

Sazza: Shut it, Graw. Olak cleared us - got a visitor for the drow, I do. || [context] NodeContext: As if at a yapping dog. Sazza and Graw have bad blood, and Sazza loves being in a position of authority above her.
Warrior Trinzas: My arse - what's a True Soul want with any mate o' yours? || [context] NodeContext: Disbelieving - to Graw, Sazza is the lowest of the low but has always had high opinion of herself.

Session Sequence: SpeakWithBOOOAL -> AD_FishChanting -> AD_GodDead
----- Session: SpeakWithBOOOAL -----
Synopsis: The player encounters a group of kuo-toa, humanoid fish beings capable of creating gods just by imagining them. They're overzealous and easily duped, and are currently worshipping a murderous redcap they've mistaken for a god of murder. He's capitalising on the situation and very much enjoying the incredible power with which he's been invested. In this dialogue, we can deal with him as this great inscrutable power, or see through the situation and expose / do a deal with him. In all cases he's brash, offensive and generally gross.The all cap lines are BOOOAL in his fully powerful form.When we suddenly rever to lower caps, it's when we've forced him into his 'common' form.BOOOAL = Boo-AHHL (almost guttural)Kuo-Toa = Koo-oh-TO-ah

Pooldripp the Zealous: Our blood to fill your oceans, oh blessed BOOOAL! Our bones to build your temple in the deep! || [context] NodeContext: Fanatic devotion, speaking to the air/altar
Narrator: *A wave of pure devotion washes over you - and with every surge, you feel a presence grow in response.*
BOOOAL: WORDS, PRIEST. PROMISES. YOUR GOD WANTS PROOF. WANTS BLOOD. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: BOOOAL is in his god form. He should be invisible with some VFXNodeContext: DISMISSIVE, IMPATIENT
: True
Narrator: *These beings are kuo-toa - former mind flayer slaves that manifest their gods through sheer belief.*
[desc] CinematicNodeContext: The priest turns to spot the playerNodeContext: The priest turns to spot the player || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The priest turns to spot the playerNodeContext: The priest turns to spot the player
Pooldripp the Zealous: YOU! Our Lord of Murder demands sacrifice! You will be an offering for the great god BOOOAL! || [context] NodeContext: Fanatic, excited
Player: Bhaal is the true Lord of Murder. Perhaps I should offer you instead.
Pooldripp the Zealous: Bhaal...? No... we are... we are faithful to Lord BOOOAL... || [context] NodeContext: Confused, taken aback
Narrator: *You sense a flicker of doubt - brief, but enough. For an instant, the godly presence falters.*
BOOOAL: NO! NO! Stop that! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: BOOOAL is in the process of reverting back to his common form. He is invisible for "NO! NO" and becomes visible for "Stop that!"NodeContext: Furious, panicked - his con is being exposed and he's losing power even as he speaks
Player: He's a fabrication. Whatever you created him for, you don't need him.
: True
BOOOAL: ARGH! NO! SHUT IT! Shut your rotten mouth! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: BOOOAL is in the process of reverting back into his common form. He is invisible for the capitalised parts of this now, but then becomes visible for "Shut your rotten mouth"NodeContext: The lack of faith is literally draining power from him - sulky and furious all in one as he returns to his common form
Narrator: *You feel the presence waver - one moment a god of awesome power, the next... a common redcap.*
BOOOAL: Ah. Bollocks. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: BOOOAL is in his common form. He is no longer invisible, and he appears as a redacapNodeContext: Realising the game is up
BOOOAL: Don't do anything hasty, now. The fishfolk got plenty of power - we can share.<br> || [context] CinematicNodeContext: BOOOAL is in his common form. He is no longer invisible, and appears as a common redcapNodeContext: Still annoyed with us but willing to make a deal. Only SLIGHTLY wheedling - redcaps aren't known for negotiating
Pooldripp the Zealous: ... blessed Boooal... what...? || [context] NodeContext: Hesitant
BOOOAL: Shut it, you!  I'm talking to... my Chosen! Chosen got power - you want power, don't ya? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: BOOOAL is in his common form. He is no longer invisible, and just appears as an ordinary redcapNodeContext: Shouting his high priest down - he wants to seal the deal with us before his idiot followers fully catch on
Player: [To priest] Well? Bow before BOOOAL's Chosen! || [approval] ['Astarion 1', 'Shadowheart -1', 'Karlach -1']

----- Session: AD_FishChanting -----
Synopsis: Fanatical chanting at the altar of a murder god, a crowd heard from afar rather than direct dialogue. This dialog has no lines that are spoken by the character - the lines are intended to be subtitles for the SFX

: *Wild chanting.*

----- Session: AD_GodDead -----
Synopsis: The Kuo-toa have found their god dead.

: BOOOAL! Our Lord has been murdered! || [context] NodeContext: Dismay, grief - their god has been killed

Session Sequence: PAD_FoundRune -> PAD_KnowStashIsHidden
----- Session: PAD_FoundRune -----
Synopsis: Party discovers a strange marking. They may or may not recognise it as a Harper symbol.

Player: This is a Harper rune. There must be a stockpile nearby.

----- Session: PAD_KnowStashIsHidden -----
Synopsis: Note: this PAD follows directly from either RecogniseStashLocation or FoundRune. See Kevin V. with any questions, I know it is a bit weird.--------When the player recognises that the Harper rune in Ketheric City is marking a hidden stash, they make an Investigation check. On success, they realise that the Harpers would be smart enough not to leave their stash in plain sight - the goal of this hint is to deter the player from interacting with the mimics in the area and to instead look around for a hidden stash somewhere

Player: Left out in plain sight like that? No - the Harpers are too smart for that.

Derryth is a bit gruff - she's a healer, but her bedside manner leaves a lot to be desired. She's also a very shrewd businessperson. She's in the underdark to get rich first and foremost.
She treats her business partner (Baelen) like he's an idiot, and pretends not to care about him, but in reality he is the most important person to her in the world.

Derryth Bonecloak: Seems the 'shrooms are letting in more people every day. || [context] NodeContext: Not friendly. She's got a real squint in her eye taking you in.
Derryth Bonecloak: You see a fella on his own on your way in? Dwarf. Baelen's his name.

Derryth Bonecloak: Right. Never mind.
Player: Need some help finding him? || [approval] ['Wyll 1', 'Karlach 1']
Derryth Bonecloak: Knock yourself out. But don't come begging for coin if you find him.

Synopsis: You come upon the myconid guards. They warn the sovereign of your presence telepathically, and it begins to speak to you. This should be creepy, hallucinatory.

Narrator: *You are swallowed by a chorus of turbulent music. Through one creature sing many voices: the harmony of an entire collective.*
Restless Myconid: ((*Sovereign. they have come. they are here*))
Narrator: *The choir fades. A single melody rises above the others, brassy and commanding.*
: ((*I am Sovereign*))
Narrator: *You see a vision: your lifeless body, wrapped in fungal tendrils. The sovereign is threatening you.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Player closes eyes as if seeing the vision in their head.

There's some reactivity depending on whether Baelen has returned to the bonecloak camp or not, and if Baelen recovered his senses by eating the noblestalk mushroom. The animal's observations reinforce that Baelen has been more amiable and gentle since his mind began to slip, and his recovery is not seen as a good thing by all.

Deep Rothé: Should leave here before master gets lost again. || [context] NodeContext: SwA line. A simple beast of burden is pleased. His master, Baelen, has returned.

 The top block: The borroding myconid is with the other myconids. You can recruit it.

The middle block: You have killed the lone duergar. the myconid now wants you to kill all the duergars.

 Next block: you have killed all the duergars; now it wants you to kill the sovereign
. 
Final block: you have killed the sovereign and it rewards you. 

This myconid does not speak with the same hive mind voice of the others. He should sound creepy, like FART in Rick and Morty, with a SLIGHT undercurrent of menace.

 As the quest moves on, he gets more and more creepy and angry,

Sovereign Glut: ((*the tumour is excised. the duergar are dead*))
Sovereign Glut: ((*here, I break ground. from the dark will a mighty Circle rise. my song will fill the Grotto!*))
Sovereign Glut: ((*death-doer - the Grotto may sustain but one Sovereign. in the Age of Glut...*))
Sovereign Glut: ((*...there may be no Spaw. eliminate the other Sovereign*))
Player: Why not. Spaw's time is done. || [approval] ['Astarion 1', 'Wyll -1']

Narrator: *Fungus and mould glaze the servant's face and body. Through music and vision, the sovereign reveals its origins.*
Narrator: *You see a frothing duergar, axe drawn, crazed by bloodlust, bearing down on a young myconid.*
Narrator: *The frightened myconid circle conjures mildewed vines. They encircle and transform the duergar.*
Narrator: *It now belongs to the circle. It will obey the sovereign.*
Player: Leave.

----- Session: DirectToSovereign_HookHorror -----
Synopsis: If you speak to a myconid after the guards speak to you but you have not yet spoken to the sovereign, his voice will speak through them.

Narrator: *The monstrosity stares blankly. The voice that echoes within you belongs not to it, but the sovereign.*
: ((*leave this one. come to me. we must speak*))

----- Session: BroodingSovereign_Leave -----
Synopsis: You try to leave the underdark with your myconid companion, and he's having none of it.

Sovereign Glut: ((*no - no. I feel the faerzress... fading...*))
Sovereign Glut: ((*I cannot leave the Underdark...*))

Barcus Wroot: Well. You... did it!
Barcus Wroot: I shouldn't be surprised, considering our history. And yet...
Player: I did. But not out of the kindness of my heart.
Barcus Wroot: I have no coin, but the foreman will be happy to provide.
Barcus Wroot: Nothing good happens in the Underdark.
Barcus Wroot: I don't know if you heard, but some of the Ironhand Gnomes - my friend Wulbren among them - have been taken prisoner in Moonrise Towers.
Barcus Wroot: I know someone of your background would fit right in in that heart of horrors, but for others of us it's quite a frightening prospect.
Barcus Wroot: And so... to Moonrise Towers I go. || [context] NodeContext: Resolute but actually pretty frightened.
Player: Do you know what Wulbren and the others were doing down here?
Barcus Wroot: No.
: False
