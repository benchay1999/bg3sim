Danis: ... and a high fence to keep eavesdroppers out. || [context] NodeContext: Just now noticing the player. Following Bex's line: 'And a house with a little door so it can come and go as it pleases.' A little wary but not too bad
-- who is this perosn who's approached them?
Player: Don't mind me. I was just passing through.
Danis: No bother. We're just daydreaming, anyhow. || [context] NodeContext: Friendly again-- player doesn't mean harm.
Bex: What about you? Big plans for when you get to the city? || [context] NodeContext: Friendly curiosity
Player: I'll be keeping to myself. People tend to stare at me.
Danis: Know what you mean.
Bex: Do we ever.
Danis: But... I've heard there's all sorts in the city. It might not be like it was in Elturel. I mean - in Baldur's Gate, they give you a chance.

----- Session: AD_BirdSender -----
Synopsis: |Druid sending a bird to find Halsin. |

Apikusis: Dark times. And getting darker.

----- Session: AD_Ritual -----
Synopsis: Five druids participate in a ritual around a sacred pool. The chant will summon a coccoon of thorns that will encircle their entire grove. Lines play sequentially, each druid saying one line, then the next, etc.They're chanting at a normal to low volume. They're attempting to suss power out from the earth itself, but they're not forcing it out. There should be a loose rhythm to it (think Arwen from LoTR when she summons the river horses), but it shouldn't come across like a drum circle.

Aelar, Karrik, Inwe, Tahan, Elwyn: Ab spiritu humoque, aculeus vitisque. || [context] NodeContext: Chanting a magic spell: Ahb SPEE-ree-too oo-MOHK, AH-coo-lay-oos VEE-tees-kway.

Apikusis: Fly quick. Fly safe.

----- Session: RitualDruid2 -----
Synopsis: This dialogue can occur in three different states: In the first, Kerrick is in a trance, chanting a spell that will cover the druid grove in thorns. In the second, the ritual has been stopped after a druid named Kagha was exposed as a Shadow Druid. Kerrick is furious - he feels betrayed by Kagha, and doesn't quite care if she's been killed.In the third, a group of goblins that had threatened the grove has been dealt with and the grove is considered safe again. In this state, Kerrick has calmed down a good bit - now that the danger's passed, he's seeing things with a bit more clarity. The player always encounters Kerrick around a sacred druid pool.

Karrik: We wasted so much time fighting each other. || [context] NodeContext: The danger has passed, but there was much infighting in the druid grove, which he believes put them at higher risk.
Karrik: Silvanus taught us a lesson by letting an outsider save us. || [context] NodeContext: Players are the outsider here - they saved the druid grove from both infighting and a goblin attack.

----- Session: RitualDruid3 -----
Synopsis: This dialogue can occur in three different states: In the first, Inwe is in a trance, chanting a spell that will cover the druid grove in thorns. In the second, the ritual has been stopped after a druid named Kagha was exposed as a Shadow Druid. Inwe is ashamed at her involvement.In the third, a group of goblins that had threatened the grove has been dealt with and the grove is considered safe again. In this state, Inwe is still a bit shaken - she knows the threat is over, but she's still jumping at shadows.The player always encounters Inwe around a sacred druid pool.

Inwe: To think we almost finished the ritual... || [context] NodeContext: The ritual that would have sealed off the druid grove from outsiders and driven out the tieflings is over. She's ashamed to have been a part of it.
Inwe: I felt honoured when I was chosen to participate. Now I feel guilty I didn't object. || [context] NodeContext: The ritual that would have sealed off the druid grove from outsiders and driven out the tieflings is over. She's ashamed to have been a part of it.

----- Session: AD_RitualDruid1 -----
Synopsis: This AD plays after the druid's ritual has been stopped. In this AD, Aelar is dazed from days of chanting.

Aelar: Complexum tuum... it's still in my head. || [context] NodeContext: Prnounced: Com-PLECK-soom TOO-oom, He's got a chant stuck in his head.

----- Session: AD_RitualDruid3 -----
Synopsis: This AD has two phases: the first plays if a druid ritual Inwe was part of was stopped because their leader was exposed as a shadow druid. In this state, Inwe is feeling sorry for herself. She's overcome with shame for being a part of a shadow druid plot.The second state plays once the goblins that threatened the grove - and necessitated the ritual - have been dealt with. In this state, Inwe isn't quite convinced the danger is over. She's jumping at shadows, imagining danger where there's presumably none.

Inwe: The air feels different. Colder. || [context] NodeContext: The ritual has stopped and the goblins threat against the grove has been defeated. Inwe is still scared - she's not convinced the threat is really gone.

----- Session: AD_RitualDruid5 -----
Synopsis: This AD has two phases: the first plays if a druid ritual Tahani was part of was stopped because their leader was exposed as a shadow druid.The second state plays once the goblins that threatened the grove - and necessitated the ritual - have been dealt with. In both states, Tahani is bitter, muttering her xenophobic ideas to herself. She thinks the tieflings (and the player) are the cause of all their troubles and that they should've been thrown out a long time ago.

Tahan: Our gates should stay closed. || [context] NodeContext: The ritual has stopped and the goblin threat is dealt with. Tahani is bitter - she blames players and tiefling for bringing trouble to the grove in the first place.

----- Session: AD_RitualDruid4 -----
Synopsis: This AD has two phases: the first plays if a druid ritual Elwyn was part of was stopped because their leader was exposed as a shadow druid. In this state, Elwyn is preoccupied with the goblins - she's afraid that without the protection the ritual would have provided, they don't have a chance against them.The second state plays once the goblins that threatened the grove - and necessitated the ritual - have been dealt with. In this state, Elwyn is calm, the weight of the goblin threat finally off her shoulders.

Elwyn: The grove isn't safe. Not anymore. || [context] NodeContext: The ritual to seal the druid grove off and drive out the refugees has been stopped, but goblins still threaten the grove. Elwyn worries that without Kagha - the mastermind of the ritual - they are rudderless, easy targets.

Dammon: My selection's pretty slim. I had to leave most of my equipment in Elturel. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: pan to selection
Player: That forge is holding on by a thread. Are you a smith?
Dammon: Of sorts. Used to be a bread-and-butter tinsmith before Elturel fell into Avernus. These days my talents are more... eclectic.
Dammon: Learned a lot in my time in the Hells. Hope to forget most of it, but between you and me, there's nothing in all the realms like the utter power of infernal machinery.
Dammon: Alas - my offerings are far more humble these days.

Unless the player is a druid, he would rather they don't linger, though he is sympathetic and will help them any way he can (by selling them supplies). He is happy to see a druid and to help them. He can be a little preachy.

Arron: Another outsider? This place has certainly become popular. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Arron turns around and wipes his hands on his trousers (he was standing at a table, with his back to the player).
Arron: Well met, and thank you for beating back those goblins. Most brave of you.
Arron: Is there anything you need? Act fast if you do - the ritual will be complete before too long.
Player: What ritual are you talking about? || [context] InternalNodeContext: needs flag.
Arron: Ah - I forgot you're a blow-in. A few days hence, this grove will be completely concealed by thorny vines.
Arron: None will be able to enter - or leave.
Arron: A drastic measure. But more monsters seem to terrorise this region every day.
Player: What about the people here?
Arron: We druids will be safe. As for those that took refuge here... well, may Silvanus guard them as they continue their travels.
Player: Seems like most are tieflings. They'll be fine. They have devilish powers. || [approval] ['Astarion 1', 'Wyll -1', 'Karlach -1']
Arron: Ignorance is agony, my friend. I will include you in my prayers. I'd better get started - for your sake.

Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Adventurer leader dialogue. Mostly used during Adventurers Quest. This is after the player has stopped Zevlor and Aradin from fighting one another. Aradin returns to his den to lick his wounds.

Aradin: If it ain't the friendly drow. Thought you were with the goblins when you showed up at the gate.
Aradin: Glad you weren't - you fight well. Not like them bloody tieflings.
Player: I think they like you less than they like me. It's almost impressive, how detestable you are.
Aradin: Thanks, mum. Now please do feck off. || [context] NodeContext: Thick with sarcasm
Player: Feck off yourself - I saved your skin back at the gates.
Aradin: Yeah, you really saved the day, swooping in and playing the hero. || [context] NodeContext: Sarcastic and punchable
Aradin: Now I'm gonna take the blame for leading the goblins here, and losing track of the bloody druid. || [context] NodeContext: He knows these things are his fault, but he's sulking and petulant about it
Player: Who's the druid you lost track of?
Aradin: Halsin. He's the leader around these parts. Or was.
Aradin: We've got a contract to track down some relic, and he wanted in on the job. Eyes lit up when he heard about it.
Aradin: Didn't work out, though. Goblins got him when we were turning tail. He's either diggin' latrines or boilin' in a cookpot by now.
Player: Did you think getting rich would be easy?
Aradin: Dunno what I expected. That much gold for some long-lost relic. ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54])
Aradin: And from a wizard, too. I shoulda known. The gold probably turns to lead the moment you leave Baldur's Gate.
Aradin: Stupid thing to die for... || [context] NodeContext: Dismissive
Aradin: But gold ain't any use if you're too cold to spend it. || [context] NodeContext: Flippant
Player: Just tell me where to find the relic.
Aradin: It's called the Nightsong. Supposed to be hidden under the temple where the goblins jumped us.
Aradin: I'd give you the map and wish you a happy funeral, but my mate Brian kept hold of it like his own todger. Goblins made short of the fat old chunk. || [context] NodeContext: Disrespectful

----- Session: Cyanide -----
Synopsis: Nettie leads the player into a lab and fetches a thorn. The player doesn't know, but the thorn is a deadly poison. Nettie knows it's the only choice she has - the player could transform into a monster and kill everyone in the camp. She sees this as a kindness - the transformation is terrible - so she has a very 'matter of fact nurse' tone about the whole thing before she scratches you, but will get stressed if you resist. Once she's scratched the player, her tone will be softer - kinder. She plans to sit with you while you pass and make it as easy as possible. The player will have to convince her they're not a threat if they're going to get the antidote. She'll be slow to convince, hesitant to allow any risk to the camp. Nettie is STANDING for this entire dialog.

Nettie: Don't worry about him on the table. I'm not in the habit of killing drow. || [context] NodeContext: gesturing to dead drow on the table

----- Session: PAD_Relieved -----
Synopsis: The player is cured from poison ( the status DEN_APPRENTICE_THORN). This status has 3 stages leading to death. Each time the player make a long rest, they get closer to death.This PAD of relief plays only if the status reached the stages 2 or 3.

Player: I can feel the poison clearing - I'm cured!

----- Session: HealedBird -----
Synopsis: The 'Wounded Bird' that Nettie was treating after some time has passed (after Goblin Hunt or Attack on Den). The bird's recovering and feels a bit better.

Wounded Bird: There was so much noise out there. I'm glad you're okay.

----- Session: PAD_TadpoleResearch -----
Synopsis: Player read Halsin's research on the mind flayer tadpole. The VB plays only if they didn't find Halsin already and didn't go through the tadpoled scene with Nettie (otherwise they got all that information from her so it's not a surprise).

Player: Looks like Halsin's our best bet for a cure.
Player: We need to find him, before it's too late.
Player: What if something happened to him?
Player: All the more reason to hurry.

----- Session: LockedUp -----
Synopsis: During the scene where she scratches you. Nettie is in the lab, sitting at a table, studiying Halsin's notes. The player can still try to persuade her to give the antidote. The player must also accept to take the wyvern poison. The other choice is to kill Nettie.

Nettie: Yes? Is there anything I can do?
Nettie: Aside from the obvious. || [context] NodeContext: A little sadly. She wants to save you, but feels that she morally can't.
Player: We can both see I have no symptoms - I'm not about to change!
: False
Nettie: Same as the drow... But Master Halsin said he'd turn eventually. || [context] NodeContext: Considering
Player: You can't do this - your leader needs to talk to me.

Tracker Worm: Minthara's gonna skin us. No one knows about this damn weapon.
Sharp-Eye Gurza: Yeah. She'll kill us dead if we go back without it.

Tracker Torrack: That's why I've been stabbin' all the rats. Might be spies.

----- Session: AD_CapturedGoblin -----

Synopsis: She drank a potion given to her by the hag, with the promise that it would make her strong as steel. It did, but it has paralysed her legs. The effects are temporary, but she's angry and embarassed at the situation she's found herself. She doesn't suspect any foul play on the hag's part. We get a clue about this mysterious old woman selling potions in the cave, and through tagged gameplay can reveal that she's been duped. She is frustrated at herself - she wanted to help in the goblin fight, and instead she is sprawled on the ground.

Pandirna: Did that...? No, damn it. Still nothing.
Pandirna: Maybe - maybe it just needs time to wear off. Fingers crossed the goblins don't return any time soon.

Okta: Best to fill your belly now - while we still can. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Holding the bowl out. NodeContext: Warmth to her voice despite the gruff exterior. She's obviously concerned about the player but is hiding it.
Player: I'm not hungry.
Okta: Suit yourself, but the only way we'll make it to Baldur's Gate is to run, and run hard. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Shrug as Okta pulls the bowl back towards her. NodeContext: Player has turned down your food. You're annoyed but hiding it with indifference.
Okta: If a gnoll catches your scent, you'll need every bit of strength. Trust me. || [context] NodeContext: Ibid.

Elegis: Glad you made it inside... doubt we'll be safe here for long though. || [context] NodeContext: twitchy - she's watching the tree-line as she speaks, expecting an attack
Elegis: There'll be more coming. Goblins hunt in packs. || [context] NodeContext: scared but resolute
Player: You could hold off a horde of goblins from this position.
Elegis: Maybe - but we're not fighters. If they broke through, it'd be a massacre. || [context] NodeContext: slightly reassured but still anxious
Elegis: The sooner we leave for Baldur's Gate, the better. || [context] NodeContext: with a sigh
Player: Leave.

Bosk: *Roar!*
Volo: Yes, I'm quite aware. || [context] NodeContext: matter-of-fact

----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Volo is a canonical character in DnD. He's known for being the realm's go-to guy for compiling information. In this take, he fulfils that role but puts a twist on what he sees. He's keenly curious for facts but likes to embellish them. A bit like Gilderoy Lockheart. He IS talented, but his reputation has gotten away from him, too. In this dialogue, Volo will offer to put his knowledge at your service if you confide you've been infected with a mindflayer. He'll perform an icepick lobotomy that'll leave you without an eye or much in the way of apology from Volo. He should be clever, a little arrogant, very English, and very fun, without being a cartoon character.

Volo: Pardon me! Must prepare to travel - good day, my friend! || [context] NodeContext: Cheerfully done with you.
Player: Where are you heading?
Volo: ...I'll tell you, if you'd be so good as to answer a few questions pertaining to the goblins you encountered at the gates. || [context] NodeContext: Trying to entice the player.
Volo: A few questions, if you please. There's no overstating my interest. || [context] NodeContext: He wants to write down what you'll say. Enthusiastic.

: True
Narrator: *You search your mind, successfully recalling various details of goblin behaviour.*
Player: Common variety goblins, led by a lasher and flanked by booyahgs.
Volo: My! A scholar after my own heart. Spent much time among goblins?
Player: The time was spent among books. I'm a student of the page. || [approval] ['Gale 1']
Volo: Aha! I've always preferred experience to the second-hand accounts of lesser men. But to each their own!
Volo: Now I've a few more questions, if you don't mind.
Volo: And the... dragon they had marching in the rear. Was it of the brass or silver variety? || [context] NodeContext: Volo is bullshitting. There was no dragon and he knows it. But he's stating it to the player as though he believes it.
Player: Heh - it was brass. No doubt about it.
Volo: 'Witness... mistook... obvious... silver... dragon... for... brass...' || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Scribbling in notebookNodeContext: Response to 'I said it was a brass dragon.' Volo is bullshitting.
Volo: Last question, then you'll be quite free. Did the attackers rally to 'the Absolute' when they fell upon the gates? || [context] NodeContext: He's wrapping things up, in full journalism mode.
Player: Yes - they called out the name like a war cry.
Volo: They did, didn't they? Oh-ho, curious. Curious indeed. || [context] NodeContext: Answers that yes, the goblins used the word 'Absolute'. He's very interested in this; very intrigued. Your confirmation is exactly what he wanted to hear.
Volo: I've interrogated one - a captive in this very camp. She reports they've abandoned their god Maglubiyet in favour of someone called 'the Absolute'.
Volo: The scandal! || [context] NodeContext: Hissed like he's just conveyed a very juicy bit of gossip
Player: Hold your tongue.

Synopsis: The player has clicked an altar from which a godly presence spoke previously.

Narrator: *There is no answer from the presence.*

----- Session: SpeakWithBOOOAL -----
Synopsis: The player encounters a group of kuo-toa, humanoid fish beings capable of creating gods just by imagining them. They're overzealous and easily duped, and are currently worshipping a murderous redcap they've mistaken for a god of murder. He's capitalising on the situation and very much enjoying the incredible power with which he's been invested. In this dialogue, we can deal with him as this great inscrutable power, or see through the situation and expose / do a deal with him. In all cases he's brash, offensive and generally gross.The all cap lines are BOOOAL in his fully powerful form.When we suddenly rever to lower caps, it's when we've forced him into his 'common' form.BOOOAL = Boo-AHHL (almost guttural)Kuo-Toa = Koo-oh-TO-ah

Pooldripp the Zealous: Our blood to fill your oceans, oh blessed BOOOAL! Our bones to build your temple in the deep! || [context] NodeContext: Fanatic devotion, speaking to the air/altar
Narrator: *A wave of pure devotion washes over you - and with every surge, you feel a presence grow in response.*
BOOOAL: WORDS, PRIEST. PROMISES. YOUR GOD WANTS PROOF. WANTS BLOOD. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: BOOOAL is in his god form. He should be invisible with some VFXNodeContext: DISMISSIVE, IMPATIENT
: True
Narrator: *These beings are kuo-toa - former mind flayer slaves that manifest their gods through sheer belief.*
[desc] CinematicNodeContext: The priest turns to spot the playerNodeContext: The priest turns to spot the player || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The priest turns to spot the playerNodeContext: The priest turns to spot the player
Pooldripp the Zealous: YOU! Our Lord of Murder demands sacrifice! You will be an offering for the great god BOOOAL! || [context] NodeContext: Fanatic, excited
Player: Bhaal is the true Lord of Murder. Perhaps I should offer you instead.
Pooldripp the Zealous: Bhaal...? No... we are... we are faithful to Lord BOOOAL... || [context] NodeContext: Confused, taken aback
Narrator: *You sense a flicker of doubt - brief, but enough. For an instant, the godly presence falters.*
BOOOAL: NO! NO! Stop that! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: BOOOAL is in the process of reverting back to his common form. He is invisible for "NO! NO" and becomes visible for "Stop that!"NodeContext: Furious, panicked - his con is being exposed and he's losing power even as he speaks
Player: He's a fabrication. Whatever you created him for, you don't need him.
: True
BOOOAL: ARGH! NO! SHUT IT! Shut your rotten mouth! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: BOOOAL is in the process of reverting back into his common form. He is invisible for the capitalised parts of this now, but then becomes visible for "Shut your rotten mouth"NodeContext: The lack of faith is literally draining power from him - sulky and furious all in one as he returns to his common form
Narrator: *You feel the presence waver - one moment a god of awesome power, the next... a common redcap.*
BOOOAL: Ah. Bollocks. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: BOOOAL is in his common form. He is no longer invisible, and he appears as a redacapNodeContext: Realising the game is up
BOOOAL: Don't do anything hasty, now. The fishfolk got plenty of power - we can share.<br> || [context] CinematicNodeContext: BOOOAL is in his common form. He is no longer invisible, and appears as a common redcapNodeContext: Still annoyed with us but willing to make a deal. Only SLIGHTLY wheedling - redcaps aren't known for negotiating
Pooldripp the Zealous: ... blessed Boooal... what...? || [context] NodeContext: Hesitant
BOOOAL: Shut it, you!  I'm talking to... my Chosen! Chosen got power - you want power, don't ya? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: BOOOAL is in his common form. He is no longer invisible, and just appears as an ordinary redcapNodeContext: Shouting his high priest down - he wants to seal the deal with us before his idiot followers fully catch on
Player: I won't let you enslave them any longer. || [approval] ['Astarion -1', 'Shadowheart 1', 'Wyll 1', 'Karlach 1']

Synopsis: The gnome leader's main dialogue. He thanks you for saving them, and tells you what brought his people to the Underdark to begin with - an expedition led by their charismatic leader Wulbren, to find a forgotten gnomish explosive of awesome power - runepowder.

Beldron: Thought we'd leapt from frying pan to flame for a moment, there.
Beldron: Fah. Thought I'd have to breathe my last in Nere's stink. || [context] NodeContext: Grateful. Breathless.
Beldron: I'm grateful, don't mistake me, but... why help us? You're one of them, aren't you? || [context] NodeContext: Guarded, sizing the player up - he thinks we're one of the cultists
Player: The cult thinks it owns me. I beg to differ.
Beldron: That didn't much look like begging. But no complaints from me. || [context] NodeContext: Referencing the player's recent slaughter of his captors
Beldron: You did just lift a mountain from our heads, so... good enough for me, I reckon. || [context] NodeContext: Nodding, accepting - not going to look a gift horse in the mouth
Beldron: Here - the Ironhand Gnomes honour their debts. With Wulbren gone, that falls to me. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Standard 'handing reward' animation.NodeContext: Drawing himself up to perform a necessary obligation - doesn't see himself as leadership material but accepts the responsibility
Barcus Wroot: Make it quick! We need to find Wulbren - now.
Player: Who's Wulbren?
Beldron: The leader of our expedition. He was sent off to Moonrise Towers.
Beldron: We were just slave-hands to the cult, but not Wulbren. He... knows things. Things they want to know too. || [context] NodeContext: Hesitant to say exactly what Wulbren knows
Barcus Wroot: What has he gotten himself mixed up in now...
Player: Before you ask, no - I'm not going to stage a rescue.
Beldron: Aye. Nor us, I'm afraid. || [context] NodeContext: shrugging, a little defeated. This line trails off into another 'Much as I want to march after Wulbren myself... we can't.'
Beldron: We have our own freedom to look to, I'm afraid. We'll take our chance when it arises, then back to the city. || [context] NodeContext: His people are still enslaved - he needs to be pragmatic.

Derryth is a bit gruff - she's a healer, but her bedside manner leaves a lot to be desired. She's also a very shrewd businessperson. She's in the underdark to get rich first and foremost.
She treats her business partner (Baelen) like he's an idiot, and pretends not to care about him, but in reality he is the most important person to her in the world.

Derryth Bonecloak: Seems the 'shrooms are letting in more people every day. || [context] NodeContext: Not friendly. She's got a real squint in her eye taking you in.
Derryth Bonecloak: You see a fella on his own on your way in? Dwarf. Baelen's his name.
Player: Haven't seen him.
Derryth Bonecloak: Right. Never mind.
Player: Need some help finding him? || [approval] ['Wyll 1', 'Karlach 1']
Derryth Bonecloak: Knock yourself out. But don't come begging for coin if you find him.
Derryth Bonecloak: If you try to ransom him to me, you'll find yourself skint and stuck with a fat old lout.

Synopsis: You come upon the myconid guards. They warn the sovereign of your presence telepathically, and it begins to speak to you. This should be creepy, hallucinatory.

Narrator: *You are swallowed by a chorus of turbulent music. Through one creature sing many voices: the harmony of an entire collective.*
Restless Myconid: ((*Sovereign. they have come. they are here*))

----- Session: DeepRothe -----
Synopsis: A Deep Rothe that belongs to Derryth and Baelen Bonecloak. A beast of burden with a simple Speak with Animals dialogue. There's some reactivity depending on whether Baelen has returned to the bonecloak camp or not, and if Baelen recovered his senses by eating the noblestalk mushroom. The animal's observations reinforce that Baelen has been more amiable and gentle since his mind began to slip, and his recovery is not seen as a good thing by all.

Deep Rothé: Master sounds different, like old self. Angry self. Don't like. || [context] NodeContext: SWA line. Reproachful. A simple beast of burden senses his master has returned to a crueler demeanour.

 The top block: The borroding myconid is with the other myconids. You can recruit it.

The middle block: You have killed the lone duergar. the myconid now wants you to kill all the duergars.

 Next block: you have killed all the duergars; now it wants you to kill the sovereign
. 
Final block: you have killed the sovereign and it rewards you. 

This myconid does not speak with the same hive mind voice of the others. He should sound creepy, like FART in Rick and Morty, with a SLIGHT undercurrent of menace.

 As the quest moves on, he gets more and more creepy and angry,

Sovereign Glut: ((*the tumour is excised. the duergar are dead*))
Sovereign Glut: ((*here, I break ground. from the dark will a mighty Circle rise. my song will fill the Grotto!*))
Sovereign Glut: ((*death-doer - the Grotto may sustain but one Sovereign. in the Age of Glut...*))

======== Scenario: for_owlbear ========
Session Sequence: LastCub ->  -> AD_HatchedEgg -> VB_CubResolution_1P -> CMB_Enrage
----- Session: LastCub -----
Synopsis: In SwA, this cub speaks in short bursts - he sounds staccato, vicious.The player has killed an owlbear - a large, predatory wild animal. The owlbear's cub remains however, and lingers by his dead mother. The player can decide whether to put the cub out of its misery, or else leave it. If the player has the speak with animals skill, they get some additional insight into the cub's anxiety. If the player lets the cub live, it will proceed to eat its mother - it's still a wild animal, after all.

Owlbear Cub: *Braawww!*

----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: In SwA, the owlbear speaks like a human. Her voice is deep and threatening - the voice of a seasoned fighter, at home in a fight and used to winning. However, she knows she's injured and at a disadvantage, but refuses to betray that to the player. Doing so might encourage the player to attack, putting her cub in danger.The player stumbles upon the nest of an owlbear; a large, predatory hybrid creature. They find themselves in a stand-off against the beast - if they get too close or act aggressively, it attacks. If they keep cool and back off when the opportunity presents itself, the owlbear will let them leave. The player may also notice that the owlbear is wounded - a broken spear protrudes from one eye socket. They may notice that the owlbear has a cub - this is the main reason for her aggression and territoriality.Additional note 1: the player may stumble upon this scenario by themselves, or they may have been pointed in the right direction after meeting some cultists who had a close encounter with the owlbear. If we won these cultists over, they may be available to fight the owlbear at our side.Additional note 2: If the owlbear mother is killed but her cub survives, we can decide the juvenile's fate. If we spare it, we may later find it being used for sport by the goblins in their camp.

----- Session: Penance -----
Synopsis: This occurs as Abdirak is beating the player. Breathless with excitement. Reveling in the act of penance - think preacher in 'god will save us, save us ALL!' mode as he, well, beats the crap out of the player. All of his reactions should be manic, joyous and vaguely sexual. Player is in front of him, facing a wall as he raises his weapon and beats the player. The weapon will be either a dagger, handaxe or a scourge.

Abdirak: The pain you suffer will cleanse you - do not fight it. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Weapon in hand (it will be either a dagger, a scourge, or a handaxe). Perhaps by his side as he takes a breathe between strikes to speak to the player. NodeContext: First time stirking the player.

Abdirak: Loviatar herself found your performance inspiring and wishes to bless you. || [context] NodeContext: Voice intimate and filled with admiration. His goddess has chosen to bless the player - a sacred gift.
Player: What would such a blessing entail?
Abdirak: Simply be still, dear one. || [context] NodeContext: As if speaking to a lover.
[desc] CinematicNodeContext: This can be anything - for reaching a hand out and gently passing it over the player to holding both hands out and closing his eyes in concentration as he passes on the blessing. As long as it is something that indicates that a spell/blessing is happening, it can be anything. NodeContext: Not voiced || [context] CinematicNodeContext: This can be anything - for reaching a hand out and gently passing it over the player to holding both hands out and closing his eyes in concentration as he passes on the blessing.

Krolla: Well, lookie here. Seems like you know your way around the course. || [context] NodeContext: Reassessing you - you've just proven yourself to be quite good at the game and she's patronising you
Player: Your rules didn't say anything about fire.
Krolla: Well who ever heard o' chicken chase without fire? We're not bloody amateurs. || [context] NodeContext: As if you're just being stupid now. Scornful - you can't play chicken chase without fire, keep up.
Krolla: Oof. Hard luck, mate. Told you it weren't as easy as it looked. || [context] NodeContext: As if announcing a goal in a sporting event
Player: Leave.

----- Session: Ball -----
Synopsis: This chicken is being used as the 'ball' in a goblin sport. The goblins chase it around an enclosure, trying to make it run between two posts so that they can score a 'goal'. It's exhausted and frightened.

Narrator: *The chicken's head bobs, eyes darting around at the leering goblin faces. She's terrified.* || [context] NodeContext: Appealing directly to the player for help. Hoping anyone will save her.

: True
Narrator: *She meets your eye, and the fear there hardens into rage. She gathers herself.* || [context] NodeContext: Desperately angry and afraid - but determind to attack the goblins and peck their eyes out.

======== Scenario: gob_drowcommander ========
Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: The drow commander is a True Soul, sent to the goblin camp in order to instil some discipline in the goblins and lead their raids. She's already had one success - at the tavern - but the adventurers who infiltrated the goblin camp are her next targets. The Absolute believes they have something of value, and she must reclaim it. The players can tell her that the adventurers fled to the grove in which case she'll see the players as perfect candidates to help her infiltrate the place, having mistaken them for True Souls.

Nightwarden Minthara: I do not have time for interruptions, sister. || [context] NodeContext: dismissive

Nightwarden Minthara: A True Soul in such a grotesque form? The Absolute has a place in Her heart even for darthiir. || [context] NodeContext: disgusted - speaking to an elf player and has a hatred of them. 'darthiir' (dar-FEAR) is a derogatory term for an elf

Player: A hunt? Who's the target?
Nightwarden Minthara: Worshippers of a false god. Their existence is an insult to the Absolute's claim on this region. || [context] NodeContext: cool, calm, sinister
Nightwarden Minthara: The thief whimpering in our dungeon tried to flee to their sanctuary. || [context] NodeContext: cold, calm
Nightwarden Minthara: We will continue to remove parts of him until he tells us exactly where it is. || [context] NodeContext: malicious glee
Nightwarden Minthara: He's been resilient but he'll talk... || [context] NodeContext: cold, with a spark of malice
Player: Perhaps you can misdirect her... or kill her.
Nightwarden Minthara: Speak, True Soul. The hunt must begin soon. || [context] NodeContext: cold, calm
Nightwarden Minthara: Enough. Speak only to me while you are in my presence. The hunt must begin soon. || [context] NodeContext: mild irritation, cold
Player: I can be very persuasive - I'll visit the prisoner. || [approval] ['Gale -1', "Lae'zel 1", 'Shadowheart 1', 'Karlach -1']
Nightwarden Minthara: Excellent - be sure not to kill him before he talks. || [context] NodeContext: arrogant, pleased

Mayrina: Gods, this place! || [context] NodeContext: Frightened and trying to keep it together as you look around.
Player: Stay put. I'll be back soon.
Mayrina: Please don't leave me here. || [context] NodeContext: Terrified

----- Session: StartScene -----
Synopsis: This is the main hag dialogue. In it, you can ask about Mayrina (who is present) or make a deal to have your parasite removed.

: Who is this? A friend of yours? || [context] NodeContext: Looks up and see the player. Looks from Mayrina to the player - cautious but not worried. You don't know why the player is.
Mayrina: No! No, I don't know them. || [context] NodeContext: Panic. You don't want to get in trouble
: Come now - aren't you going to introduce yourself? || [context] NodeContext: Slight smile as your turn your sights on the player. You're more cheerful now.
Player: Usually people ask what, as opposed to who, I am.
: That's because most people are afraid of their own bloody shadows. Not me, though. Auntie Ethel welcomes everyone.

======== Scenario: pla_stuckhalfelf ========
Session Sequence:  -> PAD_FoundChest -> PAD_Door -> PAD_TooHeavy -> AD_FoundWife
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Benryn finds himself faced with multiple crises in this dialogue. When the player finds him, he is frantic and coughing, trapped beneath a collapsed beam within a burning building. If the player rescues him, he frantically and desperately searches for his wife, who was outside when a band of goblins and drow attacked the inn they were staying at. Finally, if the player finds his wife's body, he is heartbroken - he believes her death is his fault, because of a silly argument that they had.

When players first encounter Benryn, he is trapped beneath a heavy beam in a burning building. If the player helps him escape, Benryn joins the party until they exit the building safely. Once outside, Benryn is in shock at the carnage around him - bodies of goblins and humans litter the inn's courtyard. He snaps out of his shock when he thinks of his wife, who was outside when the raiding party arrived. He pleads for the player to help him find her - when players do, she is already dead. Pointed to her body, Benryn breaks down - the weight of guilt immediately crushing him.The barbarian class will have advantage in a strength check to lift the wreckage off Benryn, however if they fail, they can try again with a higher DC. Failure the second time will lead to more debris collapsing and killing Benryn.
