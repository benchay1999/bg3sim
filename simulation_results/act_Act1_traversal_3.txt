Session Sequence: DenIntro -> AD_Victory
----- Session: DenIntro -----
Synopsis: In these dialogues, Zevlor reflects on what's happened (an attack of goblins at the gate, which the player helped with) and his mistrust of and bitterness towards the druids who are reluctantly hosting his people. He is exasperated, furious, but also eager to meet anyone who could help. He'll show a flash of anger and frustration at the start if the player struck him, but is pragmatic enough to calm himself once he realises you could be more help to him than harm.

Zevlor: Ngh. Mragreshem. || [context] InternalNodeContext: Remember he could have been KO by Aradin. The flag PostConfrontationDone will make him move after the dialogNodeContext: mrag-RESH-em. Means 'shithead' in infernal. Zevlor has just woken up after being punched in the face by Aradin. He's groggy and pissed off.
Zevlor: A cheap shot - to be expected from a drow. But you helped us, so instead of killing you, I'll just ask: || [context] NodeContext: Sneering, barely keeping his temper in check
Zevlor: Who in the Nine Hells do you think you are? || [context] NodeContext: absolutely seething
Player: Are you all right?
Zevlor: I'll survive a sore jaw. What I won't tolerate is a stranger waltzing in here and interfering in our business.
Zevlor: Lucky for you, you seem to have spooked that adventurer trash into leaving.
Zevlor: Whatever your business, I'd see to it quickly - the druids are forcing everyone out. || [context] NodeContext: Cautionary - his people are also being forced out
Zevlor: This attack will only strengthen their resolve. || [context] NodeContext: Grim, foreboding - and tired
Player: I won't be staying long - I just need to find a healer.
Zevlor: They've started a ritual to cut the grove off from the world outside.
Zevlor: We can't stay, but we'll be slaughtered if we leave - we're no fighters. || [context] NodeContext: Weary, doesn't know what to do
Player: This ritual - is there no way to convince the druids to stop it?
Zevlor: I've tried. Kagha - their new First Druid - won't even see me. || [context] NodeContext: Out of ideas
Zevlor: You, though... I know it's not your business, but she owes you for saving this place. || [context] NodeContext: Slowly and thoughtfully - considering you, idea just occurring to him
Zevlor: Perhaps you could persuade her. For more time to prepare, if nothing else.
Player: I'll see what I can do. || [approval] ['Astarion -1', "Lae'zel -1", 'Gale 1', 'Wyll 5', 'Karlach 3']

----- Session: AD_Victory -----
Synopsis: Plays after the tieflings won Attack on Den or after completing Goblin Hunt. Zevlor is standing on the plateform above the gate of the Grove and he's watching the other tieflings below.

Zevlor: Grab your bags. We're moving! || [context] NodeContext: Announcing to everyone it's time to leave. Eager, putting on a brave face.

Rolan: Well, you're here, aren't you? You can help them if you want.
Rolan: I don't believe in sacrifices for a lost cause.

Synopsis: The player speaks to a deep gnome after freeing him from some goblins, who'd had him tied to the sail of a windmill. The player discovers that the deep gnome travelled to the region as he learned his old friend is in danger. By way of thanks, he provides the player with the means to craft smokepowder, an explosive item. He then leaves for the Underdark in search of his friend. There, the player may encounter him again.

Barcus Wroot: Urrrgh... magga cammara - those pustulent thugs! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Cinematic/actor context - the deep gnome sways dizzilyNodeContext: 'Magga cammara' pronounced 'Mag-ah cam-ah-rah'. Gnomish exclamation meaning 'by the stones'.
Barcus the deep gnome is suffering some grogginess after spinning on the sail of a windmill for the last while.
Barcus Wroot: Well - get on with it. || [context] NodeContext: Still a little out of sorts after his ordeal spinning on a windmill, now a mixture of resigned and annoyed. He's expecting you to extort him now.
Player: You seem a little confused.
Player: Get on with what?
Barcus Wroot: I'm a deep gnome, you're a drow. You helped me, now you plan to enslave me.
Player: That's not what I want.
Barcus Wroot: What, then? Torture? Bloodsport? Or perhaps just a good old-fashioned walloping?
Player: You owe me nothing. || [approval] ['Astarion -1', 'Gale 1', 'Wyll 1', 'Karlach 1']
Barcus Wroot: Nothing?
Player: I'd rather know how you got caught.
Barcus Wroot: My own fault, really. I should have dropped my pack and outrun those bastards. Alas.
Barcus Wroot: Take my pack if you can find it. The only reason those goblins caught me was its weight. I'll travel lightly from now on. || [context] InternalNodeContext: Has not offered pack yet.
Player: You're a little far from home for a deep gnome.
Barcus Wroot: Ignorance is alive and well, it seems! Deep gnomes aren't restricted to the Underdark, you know - I've lived in Baldur's Gate for years. || [context] NodeContext: Testily
Barcus Wroot: I'm in search of a friend. I fear he's in trouble. He had this locket, see, that I gave him years ago before leaving home. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: He talks about the locket but doesn't have it on him to show the player
Barcus Wroot: I found it around the neck of a thug in Baldur's Gate. It was speckled with blood, my friend nowhere to be found. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: He talks about the locket but doesn't have it on him to show the player
Barcus Wroot: But I still have hope. I have reason to believe he's in the Underdark. Hopefully I'll pick up his trail from there. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: He talks about the locket but doesn't have it on him to show the player
Barcus Wroot: I always help my friends. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Looks player up and down judgementally, player should wonder 'is he talking about me?'InternalNodeContext: He hasn't given player the pack yet.

----- Session: TiedUp -----
Synopsis: The player has stopped the windmill from rotating and can now cut Barcus Wroot, the captive gnome, free from its sails. They can do this immediately, or else demand payment first, much to the gnome's frustration.

Barcus Wroot: Come on! What are you waiting for?! || [context] NodeContext: The gnome grows exasperated and panicky over the player's delay in cutting him free.
Barcus Wroot: Cut me loose! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The gnome is tied to the (stationary) sail of a wind, begging to be cut free by the player.

The sail is at the lowermost part of its rotation in relation to the ground, and the gnome is within normal speaking range.
Player: What's in it for me? || [context] NodeContext: Incredulous. His good samaritan seems to be haggling for a reward before even freeing him.
Barcus Wroot: Free me and find out. || [context] NodeContext: Impatient. He's used to being extorted.
Player: Free him.

----- Session: MagicMirror -----

The mirror hasn't been used in a long time - its master died years ago. The mirror speaks in a cracked, broken voice.

----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: The party comes across a trio of goblins who've captured a gnome and have turned to tormenting him - they've tied him to a windmill and are watching him spin around. The party can try to intervene and save the gnome, possibly using a cult symbol of authority as a way to convince the goblins, if they have it. FOR_GnomeGoblin_1 (Fezzerk) is the leader of the goblins and does most of the talking. If the player is a drow, the goblins will be much more nervous and easier to intimidate. At times, the captive goblin pipes up from the windmill, loudly pleading or berating his captors.

Fezzerk: Look what we got here - another little birdie wantin' to fly! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Cinematic/look-at context - Fezzerk notices us and calls out to his cronies. (The line is addressed to the goblin raider and scavenger, but Fezzerk's attention is broadly held by the player.NodeContext: Cruel bravado.The goblin sees the player approach and boldly announces it to his cronies - he thinks some fresh victims have just turned up.
Fezzerk: Yehehueh! Flap those wings some more, an' I'll feed you a worm! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Cinematic/look-at context - Fezzerk calls out to taunt his deep gnome prisoner, who rotates on the sail of a windmill a short-moderate distance off.NodeContext: Greatly amused. A schoolyard bully tormenting the little kid. Projecting his voice a little (Fezzerk calls out to taunt his deep gnome prisoner, who rotates on the sail of a windmill a short-moderate distance off.)
'Yehehueh!' = Fezzerk's distinct laugh (a raspy, mean-spirited slur of a laugh)
Fezzerk: An' you - hope you got a stomach fer heights! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The goblin turns back to the player (if the gnome inclusion line triggered - otherwise he's facing the player the whole time.)NodeContext: Confident, unpleasant. Turning his attention to the player to deliver a threat.
Player: I'm not looking for trouble - just want to pass by.
Fezzerk: Heh, funny. That's what our birdie wanted. || [context] NodeContext: Mocking. Refers to the player's previous statement ('I don't want trouble - just want to pass by').
Barcus Wroot: ...Release me this instant, you beasts! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Context - the deep gnome yells at his captors as he swings into earshotNodeContext: Panicked, angry. Issuing an ultimatum even though he has no means of following through on it.
Fezzerk: 'Less you wanna join him up there, you'd best pay the toll. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The lead goblin looks at his hands and tries to calculate a figure with his fingers.NodeContext: Fezzerk mockingly refers to the deep gnome's predicament as he threatens the player. 'Passing by' refers to rotating on a windmill rather than safe passage through the area, in his book.
Fezzerk: Cough it up! ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54]) || [context] InternalNodeContext: The idea is the goblin is a bit dim greedy and throwing out a stupidly high number.NodeContext: Fezzerk declares his price. (A ridiculously high sum - questionable whether he truly knows how absurd a demand this is)
Narrator: *A strange symbol glows, marked on their flesh, and something within you stirs in response.*
Player: I'm going to pay nothing, and you and your cronies are going to leave.
: True
Fezzerk: Y-you're a True Soul... I didn't know. Wouldn't dare question you, never!
Narrator: *Your blood runs quicker, feeding the gnawing absence at the centre of your mind.*
Fezzerk: We'll, erm, we'll leave you to it. || [approval] ['Gale 1', 'Shadowheart 5', 'Karlach 1']

----- Session: AD_InvestigateMill -----
Synopsis: Some goblins tormenting a gnome tied to a windmill are surprised when it stops rotating.

Fezzerk: Our birdy flew away! Go check 'round back! || [context] NodeContext: Surprised and suspicious.The windmill that the goblins are using to torment their captive accelerated and launched the gnome through the air.

----- Session: AD_UnfortunateGnomeGone -----
Synopsis: The goblins are leaving after witnessing their captive gnome get launched from the blade of a windmill at high speed. Now that their amusement's been catapulted away, they have no reason to linger.

Fezzerk: Look's like the fun's over. C'mon, let's see who else we can snatch. || [context] NodeContext: Calling to his assembled goblin cronies - 'c'mon fellas, let's wrap it up here.'

----- Session: Dead -----
Synopsis: A speak with dead dialogue with a slain goblin, Fezzerk. As he's been just temporarily resurrrected from the afterlife, he speaks in slow, cryptic, fragmented phrases. From him, the player can gain a little insight into their hostage-taking activities. If Fezzerk recognises the player as his killer, he won't speak at all.

Narrator: *The corpse regards you lifelessly.*
Fezzerk: Urgh... cold... || [context] NodeContext: A cryptic, fragmented croak, spoken by a temporarily-resurrected corpse.
Player: Did you have any valuables?

----- Session: ConfrontationLaezel -----
Synopsis: Alternate version of the dragon rider scene at chokepoint. Lae'zel is alive and was never recruited. Player can recruit her after this.

Lae'zel approaches the rider to discover where to find the creche. A cure for the tadpole can be found there - or so she believes. However, the knight is under different orders.

Lae'zel: Rider - my time is short. Lead me to... || [context] NodeContext: Lae'zel begins to bow as she speaks to the kith'rak
Kith'rak Voss: Sh-sh-shh. Such a familiar tone.

----- Session: CINE_RiderAndDragonLeave -----
Synopsis: Cinematic: Kith'rak Voss flies away on his dragon.The player interrupted the Gith Chokepoint situation. The most likely interruption is triggering a combat (player attacks any npc there including Voss or the dragon, or drags another hostile npc near them)This interruption happens in gameplay, so normally the Rider (Kith'rak Voss) and the Dragon would also leave in gameplay, but animations don't have the tech support to make the Rider ride the dragon like this, so we play this cutscene instead

[desc] CinematicNodeContext: ~The dragon spreads its wings and soars away.
NOTE: this could be used in a number of circumstances in which Voss flies away. Voss is an arrogant senior gith officer, focused on his mission, so he can always depart while being unfazed by preceeding events. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: ~The dragon spreads its wings and soars away.

--- Scenario Details ---
======== Scenario: hag_hagspawn ========
Session Sequence: SurrogateMother_Dead -> SurrogateMother_AD_HagOccupied -> Husband -> StartScene -> SurrogateMother_AD_CorpseDugUp -> PAD_AfterResurrection
----- Session: SurrogateMother_Dead -----
Synopsis: This occurs when Mayrina dies. There are multiple permutationinlcuding, but not limited to, you killed her brothers and/or her husband, she knows that one or more of these people are dead but doesn't blame you, you took her husband as a summon, and you know one of the brothers is dead but she doesn't hold you responsible. 

Sad and far away sound - except in parts when she knows you killed her family.

Mayrina: Demir... urgh... Johl... || [context] InternalNodeContext: Doesn't know whether husband is dead or not, but knows that you killed her brothers.NodeContext: Spitting with rage but also on the brink of tears. This player killed people you loved.
Player: Who are Demir and Johl?
Mayrina: My... big brothers...
Mayrina: ... drove me mad but... loved them... dead now... everyone is... dead.

----- Session: SurrogateMother_AD_HagOccupied -----
Synopsis: This is an edgecase in which the player talks to Mayrina when the hag isn't present. Mayrina is afraid, looking around for the hag - doesn't want to get into trouble. Sitting down in her chair.

----- Session: Husband -----
Synopsis: Mayrina's husband has been resurrected - but he's not the man she married. He's a horrible and decomposing zombie.

Connor Vinderblad: Raa? || [context] NodeContext: Guttural and disturbing. You're a zombie that has a decomposing jaw.

----- Session: StartScene -----
Synopsis: This is the main hag dialogue. In it, you can ask about Mayrina (who is present) or make a deal to have your parasite removed. If you keep asking about Mayrina (twice), the hag will be furious and vanish Mayrina away while she deals with the 'busybody' - the player.If you agree to the tadpole deal, you must give up an eye (in the transformed dialogue).

: Hello, sweetness. || [context] NodeContext: Cheerful greeting

----- Session: SurrogateMother_AD_CorpseDugUp -----
Synopsis: Triggers when Mayrina gets to the grave. In the top node the grave is empty. In the bottom the corpse is lying there for her to see. She leaves and does not return.

Mayrina: What? Someone's taken Connor? || [context] NodeContext: Horrified
Mayrina: I dragged my husband here in a wheelbarrow. Buried him. Took everything the hag threw at  me for him. || [context] NodeContext: Mounting anger and grief
Mayrina: And some godsdamned psychopath digs him up? I hate this place. I hate everyone. || [context] NodeContext: Mounting anger and grief

----- Session: PAD_AfterResurrection -----
Synopsis: The player's found a wand in the Hag's lair and tried to use it to resurrect Mayrina's husband. Unfortunately, it was cursed and he only came back a zombie. The players reflect on using items from evil beings.

Player: Not quite the outcome intended, but I must say - the technique was excellent.
Player: The spell is cast - what's done is done.

======== Scenario: hag_forestillusion ========
Session Sequence: 
======== Scenario: hag_hag ========
Session Sequence: PAD_TriedTart -> PAD_Fled
----- Session: PAD_TriedTart -----
Synopsis: Player eats a disguised Hag Tart, not knowing it's truly rotten and noxious. Brave (or foolish) players can eat the tart a second time, deepening their misery.

Player: Gods spare me, why did I think eating a second one was a good idea?

----- Session: PAD_Fled -----
Synopsis: In the top node player has started combat with the hag in the teahouse. She has disappeared, fleeing to her lair. In the bottom, business has been conducted peacefully and she has left.

Player: Where has she gone, I wonder?

----- Session: Victim_003_AD_HeartAttack -----
Synopsis: Lorin has been ordered to stay in the corner by the hag. The player has forced him out, and he is absolutely panicking - he knows the hag will punish him. He calls out, begging for forgiveness before clutching his heart as he experiences a massive heart attack and collapses on the floor - dead.

Lorin: No, Ethel! I'm sorry! I'll go back! Argh.

----- Session: Victim_001_AD_Dying -----
Synopsis: Edgecase for if you don't speak to the victim and he has to die. You're about to puke your guts up after being de-petrified

Efrin: The Bite! No. I don't want to die. I don't - Argh. || [context] NodeContext: You're about to puke your guts up and die a horrible death. You feel it coming - you're panicked, scared and terrified.

======== Scenario: hag_hagamush ========
Session Sequence: PAD_FoundBrothersAfterLongRest
----- Session: PAD_FoundBrothersAfterLongRest -----
Synopsis: This occurs after the player has refused to help the brothers and subsequently finds them dead/one of them dead. It can trigger in the swamp, teahouse or lair, and you may not know that Ethel is a hag at this point (depending on where it triggers). In the first, you've met the brothers, in the second you skipped the confrontation and have no idea who these men are.

Player: Be ready. Whoever - or whatever - did this could be close.

----- Session: Brother_002_AD_Fallback -----
Synopsis: Player tries to speak to the brother while either the other brother is in the shared Brothers dialogue (and this one missed it for some reason), or because they're waiting for the hag to come back into the house and start her dialogue.

----- Session: Brother_001_AD_Fallback -----
Synopsis: Player tries to speak to the brother while either the other brother is in the shared Brothers dialogue (and this one missed it for some reason), or because they're waiting for the hag to come back into the house and start her dialogue.

Demir: Hm? || [context] NodeContext: Looking around, scared but trying not to show it.

----- Session: ThankPlayer -----
Synopsis: This dialogue occurs if the player has sided with the hag in the ambush and saved her - by killing the brothers.
She's still in old lady mode, hamming up how upset she is, but there should be a hint on the last set of questions, about the gold, that this was an act and that there is more to her than meets the eye.

: Oh, my stars. || [context] NodeContext: Player has just saved Ethel. This is exactly what she hoped would happen. Still playing up the old lady act -upset and frazzled and overcome with emotion.
: I - I didn't mean for this to happen. || [context] NodeContext: Ibid.
Player: The best thanks are paid in gold.
: Oh, you're a cheeky pup, aren't you? || [context] NodeContext: Player has asked for gold in return for saving her. You're delighted at how brazen they're being. This is said in a gentle and teasing tone - with a smile.
: But I can respect someone who gets down to business. || [context] NodeContext: This is true - admiration in your voice.
: And such heroic deeds deserve proper thanks. || [context] NodeContext: A sublle hint of amused menace here.
: Why don't you stop by my house? I'll be sure to look after you. See you soon, dearie. || [context] NodeContext: Cheeky wink and a grin.

----- Session: Confrontation -----
Synopsis: Auntie Ethel has been cornered by two brothers - Demir and Johl - who claim Ethel is a hag and has taken their sister. Ethel is pleading that she has no idea what they're talking about and begs the player to help her.Ethel is actually a hag. Should we step back and do thing, she summons monsters to cut the two brothers down. Should we side with her, we have to kill the brothers. Should we side with the brothers, Ethel is angry and disappears with a threat.

: Lads, for the love of all that is holy, I've never clapped eyes on your poor sister. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Looking at the brothers - hasn't noticed the player yet. NodeContext: Opening line of the dialogue. Annoyed as you plead with the two men who advance on you. You sound sincere and genuine.
Johl: Drop the act, hag. You was the last to see Mayrina. || [context] NodeContext: Not buying Auntie Ethel's claim that she hasn't seen Mayrina. Accusation and fury in your voice - you're prepared to get violent if needs be.
Demir: Just let her go. Please. || [context] NodeContext: Your brother is on the brink of violence and you're trying to regain control of the situation. You just want your baby sister back, you don't want anyone to get hurt.
: You there! Please, I don't know what's come over these boys. I just want to go home. || [context] NodeContext: You've caught sight of the player. You call out, fear and pleading in your voice - in your mind you've hatched a plan - you're going to force the player to defend you and kill the brothers.

======== Scenario: hag_gurhunter ========
Session Sequence: Dead -> 
----- Session: Dead -----
Synopsis: We can speak to Gandrel if he dies - he'll hint at his mission to hunt Astarion on behalf of Maiden Fel. Separate options if it's Astarion himself speaking to him.

Narrator: *The corpse regards you lifelessly.*
Player: Who are you?
Gandrel: Gandrel... hunter...

----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Male, middle-age or older.Gandrel is a monster hunter we encounter outside the Hag's lair. He's pleasant, cheerful, and a little eccentric - but shows his experience and expertise when warning us about the hag. He's affable and unassuming, but shows moments of steel when discussing his quarry (Astarion). A younger General Iroh from Avatar is a good reference - someone who makes you feel good about yourself just by conversing with you.

Gandrel: Ah, a fellow wanderer. Forgive the aroma. || [context] NodeContext: Friendly - noticing a stranger, wryly apologising for the slight stench
Narrator: *You catch a waft of something foul - metallic and sickly-sweet.*
Gandrel: Powdered iron-vine. Most monsters will think twice before making a meal of me. || [context] NodeContext: Explaining the smell in the air - he's taken a foul substance designed to ward off monsters
Gandrel: An old hunter's trick - if you can't mask your scent, spoil it. || [context] NodeContext: Friendly, unassuming, as if what he's saying is perfectly conventional
Player: You're a monster hunter? Not what I imagined.
Gandrel: Hah. Perhaps that is why I have survived so long where more fearsome peers have not. || [context] NodeContext: Serene, absolutely unoffended by us basically saying he doesn't look too tough
Gandrel: You would be wise to look past the seeming of things, if you intend to bargain with the lady of this house.
Gandrel: A sharp wit will serve you better, if you're to bargain with the lady of this house.
Gandrel: That is why you come to her lair, I take it? To bargain? || [context] NodeContext: Gently prodding for our story
Player: It's a teahouse - hardly a lair.
Gandrel: A charming sight, to be sure. But the prettiest web still has a spider sitting at its centre. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Shot of sign for tea-house here if possible.
Gandrel: Her kind have hidden among us since the first darkness - and their knowledge is matched only by their spite. || [context] NodeContext: Growing slightly grave - telling us of a great evil thing that is not to be underestimated
Gandrel: Know how to ask, and they'll share that knowledge. If you're fool enough to pay their price. || [context] NodeContext: Telling us the risk might be worth the reward - but is is a great risk
Player: And are you fool enough?
Gandrel: Of course. I'm a hunter who lost his prey, and here I am seeking help from something worse. || [context] NodeContext: Amused and absolutely accepting of his own foolishness
Gandrel: But she thrives on suffering. Once she hears what awaits my quarry when I catch him, she will help. || [context] NodeContext: Growing grave
Player: Any advice on how to deal with her?
Gandrel: Scream. Turn. Run the other way - that's what I'd like to say.
Gandrel: But bad as she is, I'm betting whatever drove you to her door is worse.
Gandrel: So instead: know you're outmatched. Know what you're willing to give. And mind your manners.

======== Scenario: hag_pad ========
Session Sequence: HusbandGraveForcefield
----- Session: HusbandGraveForcefield -----
Synopsis: A forcefield surrounds a coffin. Everytime you touch it, it causes more psychic damage.

Player: Argh. || [context] NodeContext: You just tried to touch a coffin, but it has a forcefield, which hits you with psychic damage.

Synopsis: 

(Session contained no nodes with text or context)

======== Scenario: hag_hagambush ========
Session Sequence: PAD_SidedHag
----- Session: PAD_SidedHag -----
Synopsis: This VB plays after saving Ethel from the two brothers of the sister she's holding captive. Ether disappeared in a magic puff, and she was acting suspicious. The players are reacting to her exit and discussing that there may be more to Ethel than meets the eye.Speaker 1 may have been the character who was in dialog for the scene with Ethel. Speaker 2 is another party member. However, since there may be combat, this setup isn't guaranteed and it's best to write this assuming everyone had a hand in the actions that led to this VB playing.

Player: Bloody way to end an argument. I hope we chose the right side.
Player: No point in debating what's already done. Let's go on ahead.

======== Scenario: hag_gurhunter ========
Session Sequence: PAD_ProtectedAstarion
----- Session: PAD_ProtectedAstarion -----
Synopsis: This voicebark plays when a player chooses to not give up Astarion to the Gur hunter.Speaker 1 is assumed to be the player who did this action, and speaker 2 may have an opinionated comment on the outcome.Astarion can be neither of the speakers.

Player: You protected a child-stealing vampire? Bold choice.
Player: Let's hope it doesn't come back to bite me later.

----- Session: Lair -----
Synopsis: These are fired at the very beginning of the fight with the hag - tense scene. Hag is at one end of the cavern. Mayrina is trapped in a cage in the middle. Player is on the other side.

: You come to my home, interfere in my business, and now have the gall to face me in the heart of my lair? You petulant bollocks. || [context] NodeContext: This begins the fight. Roaring it at the player - likely on the other side of the lair. They've freed your captive and you are furious and out of blood. Fit to kill everyone in the room.

----- Session: DwarvenAlchemist -----
Synopsis: Derryth is a dwarven alchemist visiting the underdark from Baldur's Gate. She runs a shop in the city with Baelen, her business partner. They've come to the underdark in search of a very valuable mushroom - noblestalk. When the player arrived, she was tending to an injured gnome.
Derryth is a bit gruff - she's a healer, but her bedside manner leaves a lot to be desired. She's also a very shrewd businessperson. She's in the underdark to get rich first and foremost.
She treats her business partner (Baelen) like he's an idiot, and pretends not to care about him, but in reality he is the most important person to her in the world.

Derryth Bonecloak: Seems the 'shrooms are letting in more people every day. || [context] NodeContext: Not friendly. She's got a real squint in her eye taking you in.
Derryth Bonecloak: You see a fella on his own on your way in? Dwarf. Baelen's his name.
Player: Haven't seen him.
Derryth Bonecloak: Right. Never mind.
Player: I could look for him - for a price. || [approval] ['Wyll 1', 'Karlach 1']
Derryth Bonecloak: Please. I know better than to promise coin to a stranger.
Derryth Bonecloak: He'll find his own way out, or he won't.
Derryth Bonecloak: I'll wait a little longer. What a bleedin' waste it'd be to come all the way down here for nothing.

----- Session: AD_CheckpointGuard_002_Combat -----
Synopsis: One-shot combat AD to play when the myconid is taking their turn.

Restless Myconid: ((*the disease still festers. I will cut it out*))

----- Session: CheckpointGuard_001 -----
Synopsis: Individual myconid responds with one-liner after you have gained access to the myconid circle. Hallucinogenic delivery.

Narrator: *The creature's song rumbles within you, neither warm nor welcoming.*

----- Session: VB_GlutDead_1P -----
Synopsis: Players refuse to kill Sovereign Spawn on Sovereign Glut's behalf. Glut has attacked the players and is now dead. The party comments afterwards.

Player: The usurper is dead. So much for 'Circle Glut'.

----- Session: CheckpointGuard_000 -----
Synopsis: You come upon the myconid guards. They warn the sovereign of your presence telepathically, and it begins to speak to you. This should be creepy, hallucinatory.

Narrator: *You are swallowed by a chorus of turbulent music. Through one creature sing many voices: the harmony of an entire collective.*
Restless Myconid: ((*Sovereign. they have come. they are here*))
Narrator: *The choir fades. A single melody rises above the others, brassy and commanding.*
: ((*I am Sovereign*))
Narrator: *You see a vision: your lifeless body, wrapped in fungal tendrils. The sovereign is threatening you.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Player closes eyes as if seeing the vision in their head.
: ((*state your purpose*))
Player: I am a traveller seeking adventure. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Player closes eyes.
: True
Narrator: *Fungal roots weave through your mind, seeking your true intent.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Player closes eyes as if to see the vision. || [approval] ['Gale 1', 'Shadowheart 1', 'Wyll 1', 'Karlach 1']
Narrator: *Then the sovereign drones a new melody, cautious but welcoming.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Overhead view, as sovereign is not in sight range.
: ((*descend to me. let us speak in flesh*)) || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Overhead view, as sovereign is not in sight range. (Custom cameras required)
Narrator: *The persistent music coaxes you forward. The sovereign expects you.*

----- Session: DeepRothe -----
Synopsis: A Deep Rothe that belongs to Derryth and Baelen Bonecloak. A beast of burden with a simple Speak with Animals dialogue. There's some reactivity depending on whether Baelen has returned to the bonecloak camp or not, and if Baelen recovered his senses by eating the noblestalk mushroom. The animal's observations reinforce that Baelen has been more amiable and gentle since his mind began to slip, and his recovery is not seen as a good thing by all.

Deep Rothé: Hope master doesn't start kicking me again. || [context] NodeContext: SWA line. Reproachful. A simple beast of burden senses his master has returned to a crueler demeanour.

----- Session: AD_CheckpointGuard_004_Combat -----
Synopsis: One-shot combat AD to play when the myconid is taking their turn.

Noxious Myconid: ((*you will fall. and in death, we will raise you*))

----- Session: SocietyOfBrilliance_Scholar -----

He talks about his research and, if the tadpole is mentioned, brings his mind flayer friend Omeluum to talk to the player. The player can either agree to the mind flayer's help or attack.

Blurg: I must complete this study. Entertain yourself elsewhere.

----- Session: AD_Myconid_004_Combat -----
Synopsis: One-shot combat AD to play when the myconid is taking their turn.

Noxious Myconid: ((*defend the circle. stop the decay*))

----- Session: AD_Myconid_003_Combat -----
Synopsis: One-shot combat AD to play when the myconid is taking their turn.

Restless Myconid: ((*intruder. interloper. invader*))

----- Session: ServantHookHorror_01 -----
Synopsis: You interact with a hook horror servant belonging to the myconids.

Narrator: *The creature ignores you.*

----- Session: BroodingSovereign -----
Synopsis: A sovereign myconid we call the brooding sovereign has been displaced to this myconid circle, after the duergar attackes his home. He would like to join you as you cleanse the area of duergar as a means of getting revenge - supposedly.

 The top block: The borroding myconid is with the other myconids. You can recruit it.

The middle block: You have killed the lone duergar. the myconid now wants you to kill all the duergars.

 Next block: you have killed all the duergars; now it wants you to kill the sovereign
. 
Final block: you have killed the sovereign and it rewards you. 

This myconid does not speak with the same hive mind voice of the others. He should sound creepy, like FART in Rick and Morty, with a SLIGHT undercurrent of menace.

 As the quest moves on, he gets more and more creepy and angry,
