Wyll: Head up high, kid. To fight your enemy, you need to see 'em.
Umi: Yah! Yah! || [context] NodeContext: Attacking a training dummy.
Wyll: Almost there. Keep your hips square, and I think you'll have it!
Umi: I'm trying, I'm trying.

----- Session: AD_Trainee2Responses -----
Synopsis: Wyll is encouraging the kids to practice punching goblins.

Wyll: Good try. But don't just swing all pell-mell.
Wyll: Swing, count a beat, and swing again.
Ide: Swing, and... swing!
Wyll: Pretty good, pretty good.

Synopsis: Wyll is encouraging the kids to practice punching goblins.

======== Scenario: den_adventurersquest ========
Session Sequence: RaidAdventurer -> AD_AtCorpses -> AD_RemiraBarthAtCorpses -> AD_LeavingCorpses -> AD_AdventurerCleaningWound
----- Session: RaidAdventurer -----
Synopsis: Age: mid-30-40s.
Female
Bio: Rough and working-class. A veteran of many expeditions, Remira is nonetheless shaken after a raid gone horribly wrong and trying to hide it behind bravado. She feels guilty for leaving a new recruit to die, but tries to wave it away and gets defensive if confronted over it. She’s sarcastic and casually racist.

Remira: Ah, the fighting foulblood. Glad to know one of you has a spine. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: She cleans her wound, a cut on her arm with a [cleaning cloth]
Player: I already regret saving your life.
Remira: Ah - bruised your feelings, did I? Excuse me if I don't weep - got problems of my own. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Finishes cleaning wound and puts the [cleaning cloth] away.
Remira: My arm's near hanging off after wise Zevlor left us to die at the gate.
Remira: And then he has the bloody gall to try and blame it all on us.
Player: He let you in, didn't he? It could have been worse.
Remira: Oh, very gracious of you. || [context] NodeContext: You're trying to be gracious and she's not having any of it.
Remira: We expected a soft job. Something to test the new lad, maybe, but not a bloody goblin nest. || [context] NodeContext: She's justifying her actions - they'd taken on a job that seemed simple but quickly got out of hand. People died and she's doggedly maintaining that she's the victim. More explanatory than whiny, though.
Remira: Most would've turned tail at the sight. But not Liam, no - he charged them, the stupid bastard. || [context] NodeContext: She's genuinely hurt at the loss of this recruit but projecting a knowing persona to hide it, as if his bravery is somehow a rookie mistake. Note of incredulity rather than laughing at him, as if he did something very stupid.
Player: He died with bravery. You should be proud.
Remira: Bravery? No. When it gets you killed, it's just called stupidity. || [context] NodeContext: Scornful, but hiding real hurt. He died because she ran and she's in denial.
Remira: That was lesson one, if Liam had only bloody listened. || [context] NodeContext: Tone is very much 'I tried to train him properly but I can only do so much'

----- Session: AD_AtCorpses -----
Synopsis: Gallows humour, grimly delivered - the 'you' are the corpses of his fallen comrades, who he finds in a forest. But  he's effectively talking to himself.

----- Session: AD_RemiraBarthAtCorpses -----
Synopsis: Remira and Aradin are discussing the fate of their fallen comrades at the hands of goblins

Remira: Liam isn't here...
Barth: He didn't make it this far. You saw them grab him.
Remira: You don't gotta remind me.

----- Session: AD_LeavingCorpses -----
Synopsis: After encountering some dead adventurers in the forest, Aradin urges his remaining company to keep moving (only plays if he's not alone).

Aradin: Come on. We're wasting time.

----- Session: AD_AdventurerCleaningWound -----
Synopsis: Remira is cleaning a wound she got from the goblins. She winces and grunts in pain while checking out the damage.

Silver: Another stranger come to vex me. What will you do? Hunt me? Grab my tail? Shout until my head hurts? || [context] NodeContext: This is a wild animal and the wrong move might endanger us
Player: Relax. No one is here to hurt you.
Silver: Stupid or a liar. Neither is needed here. Go!

Lia argues that it is irresponsible to leave their kin behind. Cal is stuck in the middle.
This is a passionate and fiery argument, both sides are convinced that they are correct.

Lia: Hells, we can't just leave. They're kin. || [context] NodeContext: This is the start of the dialog but clearly an ongoing argument. You think it's your responsibility, as a tiefling, to stay and help your kin. You're angry, voice is level but will soon grow louder, and utterly convinced that staying at the camp is the right thing to do.
Rolan: I'll not gamble our lives, our futures, on people who are as good as dead. We must leave for Baldur's Gate - at once. || [context] NodeContext: You're angry but your voice is level. You think staying at the camp is essentially suicide. You cannot believe it was even suggested. You and your friends have brand new lives waiting for you in Baldur's Gate - to stay at the camp is reckless and pointless to you.
Cal: Can we all just take a moment? Please? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Looking for one to the other. Stuck in between them, pleading. Hands out as he tries to calm the situation. NodeContext: Your friend and sister are screaming at each other in front of you. Light and easygoing tone as you try to calm the argument.
Lia: What's the point in blades and spells if we don't bloody use them? We should stay. || [context] NodeContext: Your voice is getting louder. You're very angry now. It's your civic duty to use the skills you have to help people. You cannot believe how selfish Rolan is being.
Lia: These people aren't fighters. We can help. || [context] NodeContext: Ibid.
Cal: Or yell louder. That's fine too. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Sighing as he shrugs. He knows neither is listening to him. NodeContext: Your friend and sister have ignored your plea. You know once they've started they'll just keep arguing until one of them gives in. This is almost said with a shrug and in a light, jokey tone.
Player: You should all stay. A single blade could make a difference. || [approval] ['Gale 1', 'Karlach 1']
: False
Rolan: No. This place is a death trap. Let us leave - immediately! || [context] NodeContext: Player has disagreed with you. You're frustrated and angry. You think it's ludicrous that anyone would disagree with you.
Rolan: Or would you deny your brother here his chance at fortune in Baldur's Gate? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Looking at Lia but gesturing to Cal. NodeContext: You know the argument is likely going your way and you're being a little bit of a dick here. You know mentioning Lia's brother is a guarantee that she'll give in to your side and leave with you. It's a bit of an underhanded move.
Player: You want fortune? There's coin in it if you stay.
Lia: You know, that money could go towards a spiffy new outfit for your apprenticeship...? || [context] NodeContext: Smile, knowing rolan will give in
Rolan: Zurgan. Fine. Give it here. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Generic 'taking' animation. Taking coin from the player.NodeContext: 'ZUR-gan.' Frustrated but giving in to the promise of going.
Rolan: If we survive, it'll make for a good story I suppose... || [context] NodeContext: Kinda sulky but accepting that you'll stay in the grove.
Lia: Thank you, Rolan. And thank you, friend. || [context] NodeContext: Warm and sincere. Directed at rolan and then player.

----- Session: AD -----
Synopsis: This occurs betwen Lia, Cal and Ronan. There are mixed ADs which occur - when they're arguing about when to stay and go, when they've decided to stay and when they've decided to go.

Rolan: We should add the Elfsong Tavern to the list. || [context] NodeContext: Talking about things to do in Baldur's Gate - excited.
Lia: So long as you're paying. || [context] NodeContext: A wry smile, you're happy to see your Rolan so excited.
Cal: Drinks on Rolan? Count me in. || [context] NodeContext: Your sister has conned Rolan into paying - you're teasing him.
Rolan: I swear, I've never met such a pair of cheapskates. || [context] NodeContext: A wry smile even as you pretend to be grumpy - Lia and Rolan are teasing you and you're pretending to hate it.

----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: This occurs after the argument with Lia. If they're leaving for Baldur's Gate he's pretty relaxed about the argument and dismissive of Lia and her concerns. If they're staying in the grove, he's furious and is convinced they'll die here.

Rolan: I can spare but a moment - Baldur's Gate awaits! Oh, I can almost smell the city. || [context] NodeContext: Leaving for Baldur's Gate after a hell of an argument but isn't bothered. Excited to be leaving and seems oblvious to that fact that Lia is next to him, SEETHING.
Player: You're cheerful for someone about to abandon his kin. || [approval] ['Gale 1']
Rolan: Well, you're here, aren't you? You can help them if you want.
Rolan: I don't believe in sacrifices for a lost cause.
Rolan: We're leaving for Baldur's Gate. And we will make it.
Player: There's every chance you'll die on the road.
Rolan: Please. I can handle myself. It's others that are the issue.
Rolan: You are looking at Lorroakan's newest apprentice. || [context] NodeContext: Excited, Eyes light up. This is his dream. He believes he is DESTINED for this.
Rolan: Yes - that Lorroakan. The greatest wizard in Baldur's Gate. || [context] NodeContext: xcited, Eyes light up. This is his dream. He believes he is DESTINED for this.
Player: Never heard of him. Who is he?
Rolan: What? You don't know of him? I've admired him for years. || [context] NodeContext: Pride and awe in his voice. He's clearly imagining himself in the same position.
Rolan: Both his magic and political sway are forces to be reckoned with.
Rolan: Rest assured, the names 'Rolan' and 'Lorroakan' will be known to you soon enough. You'll see. || [context] NodeContext: Dismissive shrug. Stating this like a fact.

======== Scenario: den_volotravel ========
Session Sequence: AD ->  -> Bear
----- Session: AD -----
Synopsis: Volo will have some casual behavior around camp. One of these behaviors is to wander over to a druid's tame bear and try to talk to it.

Bosk: *Hrr...*
Volo: Yes... yes I see. || [context] NodeContext: REacting to bear noises as though bear is explaining something to him.
Bosk: *Huff!*
Volo: Ah, I do wish I could understand you! || [context] NodeContext: REacting to bear noises as though bear is explaining something to him.

----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Volo is a canonical character in DnD. He's known for being the realm's go-to guy for compiling information. In this take, he fulfils that role but puts a twist on what he sees. He's keenly curious for facts but likes to embellish them. A bit like Gilderoy Lockheart. He IS talented, but his reputation has gotten away from him, too. In this dialogue, Volo will offer to put his knowledge at your service if you confide you've been infected with a mindflayer. He'll perform an icepick lobotomy that'll leave you without an eye or much in the way of apology from Volo. He should be clever, a little arrogant, very English, and very fun, without being a cartoon character.

Volo: Ah, my good friend! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: He's holding a book and a quill, scribbling notations when he notices you.NodeContext: He's holding a book and a quill, scribbling notations when he notices you. He's happy to see you, he has questions for you!
Volo: Forgive my surprise. It's rare to find your kind above ground. Rare and intriguing on a day already packed with intrigue! || [context] NodeContext: polite and enthusiastic
Volo: You were at the gates just now, no? When the goblins came? You saw them up close? || [context] NodeContext: He's about to start quizzing you on what you saw. Eager.
Volo: A few questions, if you please. There's no overstating my interest. || [context] NodeContext: He wants to write down what you'll say. Enthusiastic.
Player: Fine - ask your questions.
Volo: Glory! Now, then: || [context] CinematicNodeContext: He's ready to write, quill to book.NodeContext: Player agreed to answer his questions. He's happy but also arrogant, like a rich old person saying 'you're an absolute DOLL' when you do a minor favor for them.
Volo: How would you describe that particular batch of goblins? Size? Nature? Distinguishing qualities? || [context] NodeContext: Quizzing the player, looking for info for his book. He's more professional here, curious.
: True
Narrator: *You search your mind, successfully recalling various details of goblin behaviour.*
Player: Common variety goblins, led by a lasher and flanked by booyahgs.
Volo: My! A scholar after my own heart. Spent much time among goblins?
Player: The time was spent among books. I'm a student of the page. || [approval] ['Gale 1']
Volo: Aha! I've always preferred experience to the second-hand accounts of lesser men. But to each their own!
Volo: Now I've a few more questions, if you don't mind.
Volo: And the... dragon they had marching in the rear. Was it of the brass or silver variety? || [context] NodeContext: Volo is bullshitting. There was no dragon and he knows it. But he's stating it to the player as though he believes it.
Player: I think there's been a misunderstanding. What do you want, exactly?
Volo: The truth, my friend! Not a jot more or less! || [context] NodeContext: Response to 'What are you getting at.' Volo doesn't really want the truth but he believes in his own morality.
Volo: Last question, then you'll be quite free. Did the attackers rally to 'the Absolute' when they fell upon the gates? || [context] NodeContext: He's wrapping things up, in full journalism mode.
Player: Yes - they called out the name like a war cry.
Volo: They did, didn't they? Oh-ho, curious. Curious indeed. || [context] NodeContext: Answers that yes, the goblins used the word 'Absolute'. He's very interested in this; very intrigued. Your confirmation is exactly what he wanted to hear.
Volo: I've interrogated one - a captive in this very camp. She reports they've abandoned their god Maglubiyet in favour of someone called 'the Absolute'.
Volo: The scandal! || [context] NodeContext: Hissed like he's just conveyed a very juicy bit of gossip
Player: What do you think Maglubiyet makes of this change?

----- Session: Bear -----
Synopsis: Bear in the druid grove. This is a Speak with Animals dialogue. If Volo is there, we sense his frustration at trying to communicate with Volo (who has been asking him questions in an AD). If Volo isn't there, he wants to know who we are. He gets scared of us when we tell him about the tadpole.

Bosk: Just a moment - this man is recording my story.
Bosk: I. Am. Far. From. Home. || [context] NodeContext: Articulating very clearly - he's trying to make someone who can't speak with animals understand what he's saying.
Narrator: *As the colourful man starts scribbling, the bear sneaks a quick look at the page.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Volo is excited, writing on the page. The bear leans in to see what he's writing.
Narrator: *His brow furrows. Incomprehensible squiggles surround a crude sketch: a bear disembowelling a clutch of tieflings.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Bear leans away, disappointed.

Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Nerela is wondering whether to sell a music box, the only memento she has of the husband and daughter who were killed by gnolls on the road here. It's a scam - her story is fabricated and the box is a dime a dozen. Player can comfort her or see through her story. Her overall demeanour is weary, fragile (unless you uncover her scam)

Player: |Cinematic: The woman cradled a carved wooden box, from which a soft melody chimed.| || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Lost in thought, holding the box as it's the most precious thing in the world.NodeContext: Sitting
Player: What are you doing?
Nerela: Oh! Sorry, I'm just... I'm just listening. || [context] NodeContext: Starting out of a reverie - suddenly embarrassed
Nerela: I used to hate this tune - told my husband as much when he made the bloody thing. || [context] NodeContext: Laughing, self-deprecating, self-conscious
Nerela: But it kept our little monster quiet. Reason to love it if nothing else, trust me. || [context] NodeContext: A tired and exasperated parent, remembering.
Nerela: ... how much do you think it's worth? Old Ethel said she'd offer me gold for it. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: She closes the box and plays her fingers along the lid. Abruptly, she offers it up.NodeContext: Hesitant and suddenly serious, intent on  your response
Player: Gold?  That was barely worth a copper.
Nerela: Well... I was hoping for more than that. My husband was carrying all our coin. || [context] NodeContext: Reflective, hedging around something painful
Nerela: We... we met gnolls on the road. I got away, but my husband... my daughter- || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Sobbing, breaking downNodeContext: Breaking down into tears
Nerela: I'm sorry, I just... I don't know what else to do. They say you need coin to enter the city. For bribes. || [context] NodeContext: Embarrassed, confiding
Nerela: I don't... what else can I do? They say you need coin to enter the city. For bribes. || [context] NodeContext: Composing herself, trying to be pragmatic
Player: This isn't my problem.
Nerela: ... you're right. I'm sure you don't want to listen to my prattling. Sorry. || [context] NodeContext: Hurt but hiding it - she's just told you something heartbreaking and you've dismissed her trauma.

----- Session: AD_Debate -----
Synopsis: Situation: M and L are discussing the state of the grove. Scenario 1) Child has died. A child has died at the hands of Sagha - the druid they support. L is shaken by the encounter and having doubts. M believes the punishment was just and is even inspired to do similar to the other tieflings in the grove.

2) Child escapes. M is frustrated that the child fled 'without punishment'. He believes the other tieflings will take this as a sign that they can be walked all over. L isn't so sure.

Loic: I still can't believe Master Halsin is dead.
Marcoryl: I can. He let in outsiders, then rushed off - he's made one mistake after the other.
Loic: What will we do without a First Druid?
Marcoryl: Exactly as we have always done - tend this grove. Nothing has changed.

----- Session: 002 -----
Synopsis: A very condescending and somewhat objectionable druid servant. He believes the tiefling refugees hiding in the grove have brought chaos and would gladly be rid of them, even if turning them away would doom them.

Reaction for after the player exposed the Shadow druid plot. I don't know if he'll be part of the druids who fight alongside Sagha (I don't know if all pro-sagha druids do).

Aradin: You sure you want to be seen with me? I ain't exactly popular with this lot. || [context] NodeContext: with a grimace - 'this lot' refers specifically to the tiefling refugees who are nearby but not necessarily in-shot, but he's grumpy enough that it also refers to just about everybody in the world
Player: You could try to be a little friendlier.

Player: Charming. I can see why the locals like you so much.

Sentinel Olak: Go on. I ain't gonna hold up a drow. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Olak turns to the playerNodeContext: To player. Cool and malicious.

======== Scenario: gob_quartermasterflimsy ========
Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: A trader from the Zhentarim (z-HENT-ah-rim) , a shady organisation of spies, assassins and dealers in illicit goods. The player may or may not recognise her as such, but either way her attitude is blunt, breezy and unscrupulous. She's there to make money, and you're either there to make a deal or wasting her time - she has absolutely no interest in indecision or moralizing.

Roah Moonglow: That the jingle of coin I hear? You've timed it well, my friend. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Custom CamNodeContext: Warm and welcoming (a kind of mercantile 'Who do we have here?')
Roah Moonglow: Already turned quite the profit today, so I'm feeling generous. || [context] NodeContext: Trying to coax you into a deal
: True
Narrator: *You recognise the crest she bears - the winged serpent of the Zhentarim.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Camera should show Crest of Zhentarim she is wearing
Player: What business does someone like you have in a goblin camp?
Roah Moonglow: You joking? Goblins sell the best prisoners - cheap, quiet, and eager to be elsewhere. || [context] NodeContext: You've made the assumption that there's nothing worth trading with goblins - she's the expert correcting you. As if giving tips to a novice
Roah Moonglow: Till this crowd converted and started sending their captives to Moonrise Towers, at least. || [context] NodeContext: Correcting herself. Tone is rueful - some of her best trading partners have fallen to organised religion.
Roah Moonglow: No complaints, mind - I just sold enough smokepowder to cover the loss ten times over. || [context] NodeContext: Perking up - she still managed to make a profit. Always a bright side.
Player: What do you know about Moonrise Towers?
Roah Moonglow: All I need to - there's an awful lot of folk flowing that way, and coin is sure to follow. || [context] NodeContext: She doesn't share your curiosity - but she sees the opportunity for business in Moonrise.
Roah Moonglow: Might have to find my faith and see this Absolute for myself, eh? || [context] NodeContext: Speculative, joking - she'll happily pretend to be relgious if it means making a deal
Roah Moonglow: Still some deals to be done here, though - you want to trade, or what? || [context] NodeContext: Eyeing you up, bringing you back to the topic at hand
Roah Moonglow: Now - much obliged for the chat, but I'm here to trade. || [context] NodeContext: Insincere about the chat - she's just Impatient to get back to the matter at hand.
Player: Let me see your wares.
Roah Moonglow: Pleasure. || [context] NodeContext: Affable.

Synopsis: Derryth is a dwarven alchemist visiting the underdark from Baldur's Gate. She runs a shop in the city with Baelen, her business partner. They've come to the underdark in search of a very valuable mushroom - noblestalk. When the player arrived, she was tending to an injured gnome.
Derryth is a bit gruff - she's a healer, but her bedside manner leaves a lot to be desired. She's also a very shrewd businessperson. She's in the underdark to get rich first and foremost.
She treats her business partner (Baelen) like he's an idiot, and pretends not to care about him, but in reality he is the most important person to her in the world.

Derryth Bonecloak: Seems the 'shrooms are letting in more people every day. || [context] NodeContext: Not friendly. She's got a real squint in her eye taking you in.

Player: The usurper is dead. So much for 'Circle Glut'.

----- Session: CheckpointGuard_000 -----
Synopsis: You come upon the myconid guards. They warn the sovereign of your presence telepathically, and it begins to speak to you. This should be creepy, hallucinatory.

Narrator: *You are swallowed by a chorus of turbulent music. Through one creature sing many voices: the harmony of an entire collective.*
Restless Myconid: ((*Sovereign. they have come. they are here*))
Narrator: *The choir fades. A single melody rises above the others, brassy and commanding.*
: ((*I am Sovereign*))
Narrator: *You see a vision: your lifeless body, wrapped in fungal tendrils. The sovereign is threatening you.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Player closes eyes as if seeing the vision in their head.

----- Session: DeepRothe -----
Synopsis: A Deep Rothe that belongs to Derryth and Baelen Bonecloak. A beast of burden with a simple Speak with Animals dialogue. There's some reactivity depending on whether Baelen has returned to the bonecloak camp or not, and if Baelen recovered his senses by eating the noblestalk mushroom. The animal's observations reinforce that Baelen has been more amiable and gentle since his mind began to slip, and his recovery is not seen as a good thing by all.

Deep Rothé: Master sounds different, like old self. Angry self. Don't like. || [context] NodeContext: SWA line. Reproachful. A simple beast of burden senses his master has returned to a crueler demeanour.

Synopsis: A sovereign myconid we call the brooding sovereign has been displaced to this myconid circle, after the duergar attackes his home. He would like to join you as you cleanse the area of duergar as a means of getting revenge - supposedly.

 The top block: The borroding myconid is with the other myconids. You can recruit it.

The middle block: You have killed the lone duergar. the myconid now wants you to kill all the duergars.

 Next block: you have killed all the duergars; now it wants you to kill the sovereign
. 
Final block: you have killed the sovereign and it rewards you. 

This myconid does not speak with the same hive mind voice of the others. He should sound creepy, like FART in Rick and Morty, with a SLIGHT undercurrent of menace.

 As the quest moves on, he gets more and more creepy and angry,

Sovereign Glut: ((*the tumour is excised. the duergar are dead*))
Sovereign Glut: ((*here, I break ground. from the dark will a mighty Circle rise. my song will fill the Grotto!*))
Sovereign Glut: ((*death-doer - the Grotto may sustain but one Sovereign. in the Age of Glut...*))
Sovereign Glut: ((*...there may be no Spaw. eliminate the other Sovereign*))

: False
Narrator: *...and awaits your first question.*
Player: Leave.

----- Session: MushroomField_Warning -----
Synopsis: Myconid warns you that mushrooms explode if you get too close.

Restless Myconid: ((*after the light comes the bang. step away. step away*))

----- Session: InjuredGnome -----
Synopsis: STATE NODES - first half of dialogue, Thulla is in EXTREME pain, speaking in short, terse sentences.Second half - she's weary but recovering.Thulla is a member of the Ironhand Gnomes, a group of militant gnomish artificers who came to the Underdark to find a forbidden - and extremely secret - formula for runepowder: an explosive of awesome power.Thulla is a true believer in the cause - when her group was captured by duergar, she escaped but picked up a poisoned wound on the way. She's slowly succumbing to poison - initially vague and feverish. If we heal her, she's exhausted but straight back on task, giving us the job of freeing her people.

Thulla: No need for me to ask how you fared - some of my kin have already made it here, safe and sound. || [context] NodeContext: A little more relaxed than we've seen her - eyeing us up and impressed with what she sees

======== Scenario: und_wormwall ========
Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: The player encounters a wall riddled with small holes. A successful Survival check reveals that they were created by carrion crawlers. Small characters can reach in for loot.[Editor's note: try to think of some alternate ways of getting to the loot that don't involve choosing a gnome or halflng at the start of the game.][Scripter comment: we have spell Enlarge/Reduce planned, but I've also added Mage Hand support. Thanks!]

Narrator: *The wall is riddled with holes. A suffocating stench of long-rotten meat wafts out.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: camera on holes in cavern wall

Narrator: *As you near the rubble, a fragmented voice clutches at your mind.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Nere starting to Mindmeld with the player
Nere: A Tru... Sou... True Soul? || [context] NodeContext: The original line is 'A True Soul? This is Nere. Tell those Imbiciles to hurry up! I am choking on poison.' Should be recorded normally, and effects should be added later to make it sound like the voice is fading in and out.
Nere: Finally! You must clear... rubble. Filling... poison!
Player: Stay still. I'll do what I can.
Nere: ...it quick or... head! Careful... mercs... on the edge...
Nere: ...Get me OUT!

Nere: Important business. My orders come from General Thorm himself.

Player: The General? Is he a favourite of the Absolute?
Nere: The favourite. Nothing is done in these lands without his knowledge.

If the player rescues him, he frantically and desperately searches for his wife, who was outside when a band of goblins and drow attacked the inn they were staying at. Finally, if the player finds his wife's body, he is heartbroken - he believes her death is his fault, because of a silly argument that they had.

When players first encounter Benryn, he is trapped beneath a heavy beam in a burning building. If the player helps him escape, Benryn joins the party until they exit the building safely. Once outside, Benryn is in shock at the carnage around him - bodies of goblins and humans litter the inn's courtyard. He snaps out of his shock when he thinks of his wife, who was outside when the raiding party arrived. He pleads for the player to help him find her - when players do, she is already dead. Pointed to her body, Benryn breaks down - the weight of guilt immediately crushing him.The barbarian class will have advantage in a strength check to lift the wreckage off Benryn, however if they fail, they can try again with a higher DC.

----- Session: Flind -----
Synopsis: The flind is the leader of a pack of gnolls. Normally, these monsters hunger for flesh and eat anything, but the flind has been infected with a mind flayer's tadpole (like the players) and this has created an internal 'Voice' that guides it toward certain meat, forbidding others. The forbidden meats are those that work for the mind flayers - including the players - leading to a telepathic 'dialogue' when the flind restrains itself from attacking and calls off its pack.

We can attempt to overpower the Flind psionically, allowing us to control it temporarily in order to destroy the pack of gnolls. If we choose to fight the Flind, we should be prepared for a difficult encounter. It is strong, though far from the most powerful of its kind thanks to the war raging in its brain.

Narrator: *She is still ravenous, her mind a hungry pit. The flesh of her pack wasn't enough to satisfy her.* || [context] NodeContext: 'she' is a monstrous gnoll - it is hungry for the player's flesh. Anxiety in the player's voice

----- Session: CINE_RiderAndDragonLeave -----
Synopsis: Cinematic: Kith'rak Voss flies away on his dragon.The player interrupted the Gith Chokepoint situation.

[desc] CinematicNodeContext: ~The dragon spreads its wings and soars away.
NOTE: this could be used in a number of circumstances in which Voss flies away. Voss is an arrogant senior gith officer, focused on his mission, so he can always depart while being unfazed by preceeding events. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: ~The dragon spreads its wings and soars away.

While reading our thoughts, the githyanki may realise we are tadpoled, resulting in instant combat. If we manage to conceal our tadpoles, they may allow us to pass.

Kith'rak Voss: You are unknown to me, kin. Are you straight from the crèche, wandering unbidden?

Synopsis: PAD that plays if you decide to tell the Gur Hunter in the Swamp where to find Astarion (HAG_GurHunter.lsj).  You tell the Hunter where your camp is, the Hunter says he'll take Astarion during the night the next time you go to sleep, then the dialog ends and this PAD plays.Your companion reacts to your decision to hand Astarion over (speaker 2) and then you clarify/justify your decision (speaker 1)

Player: You gave him up? I wasn't sure you would.
Player: He's too dangerous to have around. We'd always be sleeping with one eye open.

Annoyed as you plead with the two men who advance on you. You sound sincere and genuine.
Johl: Drop the act, hag. You was the last to see Mayrina. || [context] NodeContext: Not buying Auntie Ethel's claim that she hasn't seen Mayrina. Accusation and fury in your voice - you're prepared to get violent if needs be.
Demir: Just let her go. Please. || [context] NodeContext: Your brother is on the brink of violence and you're trying to regain control of the situation. You just want your baby sister back, you don't want anyone to get hurt.
: You there! Please, I don't know what's come over these boys. I just want to go home. || [context] NodeContext: You've caught sight of the player.

: I don't want a crumb left on that plate, girl. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: ~Standing, Mayrina sets a plate down on the table, pie still on itNodeContext: Cheerful granny voice - you're merrily ordering Mayrina about
Mayrina: Auntie Ethel, please. One more bite and this pie is gonna come back up to say hello. || [context] NodeContext: Trying to stick up for yourself but a touch of fear in your voice. You know she's a hag and you should do as she says but you feel nauseous and sick.
: Don't make me get the wooden spoon. You're eating for two, so get to it! || [context] InternalNodeContext: Next node - sees player.NodeContext: A cheery rhythm to your voice even at the steel to your tone. You will be obeyed.
: Who is this? A friend of yours? || [context] NodeContext: Looks up and see the player. Looks from Mayrina to the player - cautious but not worried. You don't know why the player is.
Mayrina: No! No, I don't know them. || [context] NodeContext: Panic. You don't want to get in trouble
: Come now - aren't you going to introduce yourself? || [context] NodeContext: Slight smile as your turn your sights on the player. You're more cheerful now.
Player: Usually people ask what, as opposed to who, I am.
: That's because most people are afraid of their own bloody shadows. Not me, though. Auntie Ethel welcomes everyone.

----- Session: PAD_AfterResurrection -----
Synopsis: The player's found a wand in the Hag's lair and tried to use it to resurrect Mayrina's husband. Unfortunately, it was cursed and he only came back a zombie. The players reflect on using items from evil beings.

----- Session: PAD_TriedTart -----
Synopsis: Player eats a disguised Hag Tart, not knowing it's truly rotten and noxious. Brave (or foolish) players can eat the tart a second time, deepening their misery.

======== Scenario: hag_well ========
Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: This well sits just outside of the hag's teahouse. When the player drinks from it, they feel a rush of power and gain a positive status (regardless of whether the illusion is up or down). However, once they enter combat with the hag, it turns to poison in their veins.
