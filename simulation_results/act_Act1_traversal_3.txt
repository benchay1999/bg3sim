Player: Better a quick draught than ceremorphosis, nonetheless.
Player: Better to have on hand than not.

----- Session: AD_Busy -----
Synopsis: Nettie is dealing with a player and has been interrupted by another player.

Nettie: Not now. I'm busy. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Hand raised in a sign to wait and then turns back to what she was doing .NodeContext: Terse, impatient. She's dealing with serious matters right now.

----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Nettie is the apprentice of Halsin, the missing druid. We can tell her about the parasite in our heads. She listens with compassion but decides the player is too dangerous and must be quarantined. If she knows about the parasite, she'll invite the player to come with her deeper into her rooms for "treatement."

Nettie: Drow. Last time I saw one of you folk, he tried to slit me open. I hope you're more agreeable. || [context] NodeContext: Doesn't like drow, but she's willing to give you a chance.
Player: Where did you see another drow?

Player: No good way of putting this. I... uh... have a tadpole in my head.
Nettie: A tadpole? A mind flayer tadpole? || [context] NodeContext: Suddenly grave, giving you her full attention. A mind flayer is an incredibly dangerous creature.
Player: You know of them? Can you help me?

Nettie: Come, follow me. I might be able to help. || [context] NodeContext: In command, but grave. She's decided she has to kill the player.

----- Session: AD -----
Synopsis: This triggers as Nettie is at her desk in Halsin's lab, researching and organising. The bird she was treating may have died at this point.

Nettie: Halsin would have known what to do. Damn it all.

----- Session: Bird -----
Synopsis: This bird has been told to go and find Halsin and you're interupting him just as he's getting ready to take flight. He's tense and in a hurry to be gone, so he'll only answer one question before taking to the skies and carrying out his mission.

Tingmiaq: Not now. Places to be.
Player: Where are you going?
Tingmiaq: To find Halsin. There's not a moment to lose!

----- Session: AD_TadpoledStart -----
Synopsis: Nettie's comments as she walks with the 'infected' player to the storage room, where they will be quarantined.

Nettie: We need to be quick. This way. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Gesturing for the player to follower her as she escorts them to the storage room, where they will be quarantined. NodeContext: Concerned

----- Session: PAD_SeeDrow -----
Synopsis: The player broke inside the room without Nettie. Normally they follow her inside and they get the info from her. The VB stops playing when the tadpoled scene with Nettie starts or when Halsin is found in the goblin camp.

Player: I wonder what happened to that drow.
Player: Is there a dead tadpole in that jar?
Player: And look at that statue.
Player: I can't tell if this is a temple or a library.

----- Session: AD_TadpoledCombat -----
Synopsis: The player triggered combat during the tadpoled scene

Nettie: I don't want to hurt you - but I have to protect the others.

----- Session: AD_WithBird -----
Synopsis: Nettie is tending to a badly wounded bird. The bird is weak, its life hangs in the balance, but Nettie is doing what she can.

Nettie: They did a number on you, didn't they? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Hunched over the bird, moving hands over it.NodeContext: Sadly
Nettie: Does that hurt? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Hunched over the bird, moving hands over it.NodeContext: Gently, as if to a child
Wounded Bird: *Chirp!* || [context] NodeContext: Pained chirp
Nettie: I know. We're nearly done. || [context] NodeContext: Sympathetic

----- Session: CombatStarts -----
Synopsis: The player is locked in Nettie's lab and has cured themselves before persuading her. Normally, script starts the dialog 'DEN_Apprentice_LockedUp' to react to this, but it can fail if the player is wild shaped for example. This node taken from the dialog 'DEN_CGB_Apprentice' gives the feedback thatNettie is going hostile.

Nettie: I tried to make this easy on you and give you some time. But if you won't stop, I'll have to stop you.

----- Session: HealedBird -----
Synopsis: The 'Wounded Bird' that Nettie was treating after some time has passed (after Goblin Hunt or Attack on Den). The bird's recovering and feels a bit better.

Wounded Bird: There was so much noise out there. I'm glad you're okay.

----- Session: PAD_TadpoleResearch -----
Synopsis: Player read Halsin's research on the mind flayer tadpole. The VB plays only if they didn't find Halsin already and didn't go through the tadpoled scene with Nettie (otherwise they got all that information from her so it's not a surprise).

Player: Looks like Halsin's our best bet for a cure.
Player: We need to find him, before it's too late.
Player: What if something happened to him?
Player: All the more reason to hurry.

----- Session: AD_ToStorage -----
Synopsis: Nettie has arrived with the 'infected' player and is  gesturing for them go into the storage unit.

Nettie: Head on in.

----- Session: AD_Studying -----
Synopsis: After poisoning the tadpoled player, Nettie settles down at her old Master's desk to see if she can uncover any secrets about the tadpole in his research.

Nettie: I'll see if there's anything in Master Halsin's notes.
Nettie: He didn't find a cure, but maybe we can make you comfortable.

======== Scenario: den_adventurersquest ========
Session Sequence: RaidAdventurerAtCorpses -> RaidAdventurer -> LeaderAtCorpses -> AD_LeavingCorpses -> AD_AdventurerCleaningWound
----- Session: RaidAdventurerAtCorpses -----
Synopsis: The adventurer is standing next to the corpses of her comrades she left behind while running for the goblins.

Remira: I told them to run, the idiots.
Remira: You better turn north here, or you'll end up like them.

----- Session: RaidAdventurer -----
Synopsis: Age: mid-30-40s.
Female
Bio: Rough and working-class. A veteran of many expeditions, Remira is nonetheless shaken after a raid gone horribly wrong and trying to hide it behind bravado. She feels guilty for leaving a new recruit to die, but tries to wave it away and gets defensive if confronted over it. She’s sarcastic and casually racist.

Remira: Ah, the fighting foulblood. Glad to know one of you has a spine. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: She cleans her wound, a cut on her arm with a [cleaning cloth]
Player: I already regret saving your life.
Remira: Ah - bruised your feelings, did I? Excuse me if I don't weep - got problems of my own. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Finishes cleaning wound and puts the [cleaning cloth] away.
Remira: My arm's near hanging off after wise Zevlor left us to die at the gate.
Remira: And then he has the bloody gall to try and blame it all on us.
Player: He let you in, didn't he? It could have been worse.
Remira: Oh, very gracious of you. || [context] NodeContext: You're trying to be gracious and she's not having any of it.
Remira: We expected a soft job. Something to test the new lad, maybe, but not a bloody goblin nest. || [context] NodeContext: She's justifying her actions - they'd taken on a job that seemed simple but quickly got out of hand. People died and she's doggedly maintaining that she's the victim. More explanatory than whiny, though.
Remira: Most would've turned tail at the sight. But not Liam, no - he charged them, the stupid bastard. || [context] NodeContext: She's genuinely hurt at the loss of this recruit but projecting a knowing persona to hide it, as if his bravery is somehow a rookie mistake. Note of incredulity rather than laughing at him, as if he did something very stupid.
Player: Leave.

----- Session: LeaderAtCorpses -----
Synopsis: Aradin comes across the corpses of some of his friends, who were lost during the goblin raid. He's in a neutral location at a bridge and observing the corpses of his people and of goblins, who were also killed in the fight.

Aradin: Thought you was busy with the foulbloods in Halsin's grove.

----- Session: AD_LeavingCorpses -----
Synopsis: After encountering some dead adventurers in the forest, Aradin urges his remaining company to keep moving (only plays if he's not alone).

Aradin: Come on. We're wasting time.

----- Session: AD_AdventurerCleaningWound -----
Synopsis: Remira is cleaning a wound she got from the goblins. She winces and grunts in pain while checking out the damage.

Remira: Wound looks clean. Small mercies.

Synopsis: In these dialogues, Zevlor reflects on what's happened (an attack of goblins at the gate, which the player helped with) and his mistrust of and bitterness towards the druids who are reluctantly hosting his people. He is exasperated, furious, but also eager to meet anyone who could help. In the same dialogue, we can also uncover that he is in fact a traitor, concerned only with getting these people through the goblins so he can trade them for his own safety later. In truth he is resentful and contemptuous of them, viewing them as weak.

Session Sequence: Group -> AD -> Brother
----- Session: Group -----
Synopsis: Three people are having an argument. Rolan, Lia and Cal. Lia and Cal are brother and sister, but the three of them have grown up together. They're young, talented tieflings who are heading to Baldur's Gate to start their lives and careers. Rolan argues that they should leave now and get to the city while they still can. Lia argues that it is irresponsible to leave their kin behind. Cal is stuck in the middle.
This is a passionate and fiery argument, both sides are convinced that they are correct.

Lia: Hells, we can't just leave. They're kin. || [context] NodeContext: This is the start of the dialog but clearly an ongoing argument. You think it's your responsibility, as a tiefling, to stay and help your kin. You're angry, voice is level but will soon grow louder, and utterly convinced that staying at the camp is the right thing to do.
Rolan: I'll not gamble our lives, our futures, on people who are as good as dead. We must leave for Baldur's Gate - at once. || [context] NodeContext: You're angry but your voice is level. You think staying at the camp is essentially suicide. You cannot believe it was even suggested. You and your friends have brand new lives waiting for you in Baldur's Gate - to stay at the camp is reckless and pointless to you.
Cal: Can we all just take a moment? Please? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Looking for one to the other. Stuck in between them, pleading. Hands out as he tries to calm the situation. NodeContext: Your friend and sister are screaming at each other in front of you. Light and easygoing tone as you try to calm the argument.
Lia: What's the point in blades and spells if we don't bloody use them? We should stay. || [context] NodeContext: Your voice is getting louder. You're very angry now. It's your civic duty to use the skills you have to help people. You cannot believe how selfish Rolan is being.
Lia: These people aren't fighters. We can help. || [context] NodeContext: Ibid.
Cal: Or yell louder. That's fine too. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Sighing as he shrugs. He knows neither is listening to him. NodeContext: Your friend and sister have ignored your plea. You know once they've started they'll just keep arguing until one of them gives in. This is almost said with a shrug and in a light, jokey tone.
Player: You should all stay. A single blade could make a difference. || [approval] ['Gale 1', 'Karlach 1']
: False
Rolan: No. This place is a death trap. Let us leave - immediately! || [context] NodeContext: Player has disagreed with you. You're frustrated and angry. You think it's ludicrous that anyone would disagree with you.
Rolan: Or would you deny your brother here his chance at fortune in Baldur's Gate? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Looking at Lia but gesturing to Cal. NodeContext: You know the argument is likely going your way and you're being a little bit of a dick here. You know mentioning Lia's brother is a guarantee that she'll give in to your side and leave with you. It's a bit of an underhanded move.
Player: You want fortune? There's coin in it if you stay.
Lia: You know, that money could go towards a spiffy new outfit for your apprenticeship...? || [context] NodeContext: Smile, knowing rolan will give in
Rolan: Zurgan. Fine. Give it here. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Generic 'taking' animation. Taking coin from the player.NodeContext: 'ZUR-gan.' Frustrated but giving in to the promise of going.
Rolan: If we survive, it'll make for a good story I suppose... || [context] NodeContext: Kinda sulky but accepting that you'll stay in the grove.
Lia: Thank you, Rolan. And thank you, friend. || [context] NodeContext: Warm and sincere. Directed at rolan and then player.

Rolan: We don't even know these people! || [context] NodeContext: Arguing with Lia. He thinks her suggestion to stay is suicide.
Lia: That doesn't matter. || [context] NodeContext: Rolan has claimed you don't even know the other tieflings. You're snapping back.
Rolan: Of course it does. You would choose strangers over us!
Lia: That's not what I said.
Cal: Can we stop shouting? No? || [context] NodeContext: You sister and your best friend are arguing and it's getting progressively heated. You're trying to calm the situation but you also know they're going to keep ignoring you.

----- Session: Brother -----
Synopsis: This dialog occurs after the argument between Lia and Rolan that Cal attempted to mediate. It's light and friendly, and mainly a chance for the player to get to know Cal.

Cal: Lia and Rolan would never admit it, but they'd take an arrow for the other. Also stab each other. Not sure what'll come first. || [context] NodeContext: You have broken up a fight between Lia and Rolan more times than you can count. You're tone is light and friendly as you joke with the player.

Not looking at the player. NodeContext: Softly singing. Sadness in every note. There is a small pause between every line as you softly sing.
Player: What's that tune you're singing?
Alfira: More like butchering. Don't know why I bother. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Looking at lute - frustratedNodeContext: Speaking of her own music. Embarassed and frustrated with herself. Dejected.
Player: Are you all right?
Alfira: No. I'm moments away from a grisly death... || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Looks at player. NodeContext: Sarcasm mixed with frustation.
Alfira: ...at the hands of this bloody song. I can't... nothing fits, you know? || [context] NodeContext: Annoyed and frustrated with herself.
Player: Why are you songwriting now? Hardly the best time.
Alfira: I... we lost people on the way here. || [context] NodeContext: She's thinking of her teacher who died on the way. Grief in her voice.
Alfira: And the dead deserve to be remembered. That's what my teacher always said. || [context] NodeContext: She's thinking of her teacher who died on the way. Grief in her voice.
Player: This grove could become a battlefield soon enough. It's not the time for music.
Alfira: I know. I should be packing up, but I need to finish this song. It's... it's important. || [context] NodeContext: Player has advised her to leave. But she can't - she has to finish her song. Frustrated, mainly at herself.
Player: Snatch the lute out of her hands and smash it. || [approval] ['Astarion 1', 'Gale -1', "Lae'zel 1", 'Wyll -1', 'Karlach -1']
: False
Alfira: You horrid, horrid beast. What is wrong with you? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Player reaches out to grab Alfira's lute. Alfira stays seated - twists her body to the side out of the way. While saying first phrase. Stands up after first phrase. Then says 'What is wrong with you?'. Holding own lute close.
Alfira: Get the hells away from me. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Holding own lute close.NodeContext: Angry.

----- Session: Animals -----
Synopsis: This occurs as the bard, Alfira is playing her lute. The animals are NOT impressed and making fun of her and the player. They are very dramatic.

Corinna: It hurts! It hurts! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The camera starts on the bard, then pans to the animals.InternalNodeContext: We should be able to hear the bards song in the background, overshadowed be the animals complaining.NodeContext: The animals are listening to someone sing and play the lute. They hate the sound and are uncomfortable.
Spar: Please, make it stop! || [context] NodeContext: The animals are listening to someone sing and play the lute. They hate the sound and are uncomfortable.
Player: Slow down - what's wrong?
Corinna: Can't you hear it? || [context] NodeContext: played seriousness.
Corinna: Her singing - it's awful! || [context] NodeContext: played seriousness.
Spar: Terrible! || [context] NodeContext: played seriousness.
Player: Don't mock her - she's trying her best... I assume.
Spar: Oh no! Whatever shall we do? || [context] NodeContext: amused, ironic, making fun of the player.
Corinna: More witless creatures! More ear-bleed! || [context] NodeContext: amused, ironic, making fun of the player.
Corinna: My head is melting! I'm leaving before the damage is permanent. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The critters leave.NodeContext: amused, ironic, making fun of the player.

----- Session: AD_StartingOver -----
Synopsis: AD that plays after the bard has been told to start over. She is holding her lute. Not plucking it occasionally but not really playing.

Alfira: No. That's stupid. || [context] NodeContext: Player has convinced her to start from scratch with the song. Doubts herself. Hates what she's working on. Dejected.

----- Session: AD_InstrumentStolen -----
Synopsis: The bard is sitting. Snaps at the player.

Alfira: Get away from me. I mean it! || [context] NodeContext: Player has stolen her dead teacher's instrument. You're upset and yelling at the player.

----- Session: AD_Dejected -----
Synopsis: Dejected/crying because her instrument was stolen or smashed by a player.

Alfira: There's no point - damn it. || [context] NodeContext: She has 'lost' her instrument (player stole it). You are on the brink of tears, feeling lost and ashamed - you wanted to write a song for your teacher, and now you never will. You feel like a failure.

======== Scenario: den_volotravel ========
Session Sequence: AD -> 
----- Session: AD -----
Synopsis: Volo will have some casual behavior around camp. One of these behaviors is to wander over to a druid's tame bear and try to talk to it.

Volo: Would that we could speak freely, my ursine friend! || [context] NodeContext: Pleading with theatrical, wistful flair
Volo: Alas, I've never learned to converse with your kind. || [context] NodeContext: Pleading with theatrical, wistful flair
Bosk: *Roar!*
Volo: Yes, I'm quite aware. || [context] NodeContext: matter-of-fact

----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Volo is a canonical character in DnD. He's known for being the realm's go-to guy for compiling information. In this take, he fulfils that role but puts a twist on what he sees. He's keenly curious for facts but likes to embellish them. A bit like Gilderoy Lockheart. He IS talented, but his reputation has gotten away from him, too. In this dialogue, Volo will offer to put his knowledge at your service if you confide you've been infected with a mindflayer. He'll perform an icepick lobotomy that'll leave you without an eye or much in the way of apology from Volo. He should be clever, a little arrogant, very English, and very fun, without being a cartoon character.

Volo: Pardon me! Must prepare to travel - good day, my friend! || [context] NodeContext: Cheerfully done with you.
Player: Where are you heading?
Volo: ...I'll tell you, if you'd be so good as to answer a few questions pertaining to the goblins you encountered at the gates. || [context] NodeContext: Trying to entice the player.
Volo: A few questions, if you please. There's no overstating my interest. || [context] NodeContext: He wants to write down what you'll say. Enthusiastic.
Player: Fine - ask your questions.
Volo: Glory! Now, then: || [context] CinematicNodeContext: He's ready to write, quill to book.NodeContext: Player agreed to answer his questions. He's happy but also arrogant, like a rich old person saying 'you're an absolute DOLL' when you do a minor favor for them.
Volo: How would you describe that particular batch of goblins? Size? Nature? Distinguishing qualities? || [context] NodeContext: Quizzing the player, looking for info for his book. He's more professional here, curious.
: True
Narrator: *You search your mind, successfully recalling various details of goblin behaviour.*
Player: Common variety goblins, led by a lasher and flanked by booyahgs.
Volo: My! A scholar after my own heart. Spent much time among goblins?
Player: The time was spent among books. I'm a student of the page. || [approval] ['Gale 1']
Volo: Aha! I've always preferred experience to the second-hand accounts of lesser men. But to each their own!
Volo: Now I've a few more questions, if you don't mind.
Volo: And the... dragon they had marching in the rear. Was it of the brass or silver variety? || [context] NodeContext: Volo is bullshitting. There was no dragon and he knows it. But he's stating it to the player as though he believes it.
Player: Dragon...? There wasn't any dragon.
Volo: 'Witnesses... failed... to... notice the... obvious... dragon...' || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Scribbling in notebookNodeContext: Response to 'I told him there was no dragon.' Volo's sensationalizing again.
Volo: Last question, then you'll be quite free. Did the attackers rally to 'the Absolute' when they fell upon the gates? || [context] NodeContext: He's wrapping things up, in full journalism mode.
Player: I don't think so. I was concentrating on not dying.
Volo: Really? Well, this does complicate things... but then again... well, never mind. || [context] NodeContext: Player says goblins didn't invoke 'the Absolute.' Volo is turning the idea around in his head, trying to figure it out. A man in thought.
Volo: I've interrogated one - a captive in this very camp. She reports they've abandoned their god Maglubiyet in favour of someone called 'the Absolute'.
Volo: The scandal! || [context] NodeContext: Hissed like he's just conveyed a very juicy bit of gossip
Player: Hold your tongue.
Volo: Never you mind. I'm on my way to their camp as we speak. I always knew my studies in Ghukliak would come to some use.

======== Scenario: den_wyllrecruitment ========
Session Sequence: AD_Training -> AD_Trainee3Responses
----- Session: AD_Training -----
Synopsis: Wyll is encouraging the kids to practice punching goblins.

Wyll: Good work, kids. You're all heroes, each and every one of you.

----- Session: AD_Trainee3Responses -----
Synopsis: Wyll is encouraging the kids to practice punching goblins.

Gan: I'm going to kill so many goblins.
Ide: How many? || [context] NodeContext: Challenging - "You can't be doing more than me!"
Gan: Like six.
Ide: I'm going to kill six hundred. || [context] NodeContext: One-upping the previous person.
Wyll: Focus, children.

======== Scenario: den_lockdown ========
Session Sequence: PAD_Comment
----- Session: PAD_Comment -----
Synopsis: This VB plays when players first see the results of a druid ritual: indestructible vines have enveloped the entire grove, sealing it off from the outside world. Players cannot get past them to the grove within.

Player: Looks like the ritual worked. The whole grove is walled in. || [context] NodeContext: Karlach: Sad. tieflings trapped inside.

======== Scenario: den_thinglikeme ========
Session Sequence: 
======== Scenario: den_druidlair ========
Session Sequence: VB_UnlockedStudy -> FrescoFoundingGrove -> VB_LockedLibrary -> VB_ObtainedReward
----- Session: VB_UnlockedStudy -----
Synopsis: |You retrieved the missing wolf rune, placed it back in the socket, clicked on the 4 runes and now the wolf statue is sinking down in the ground, revealing spiral stairs.|

Player: Well well, what have we here. || [context] NodeContext: Intrigued.

----- Session: FrescoFoundingGrove -----
Synopsis: Player is examining a mural on the wall of the Druid's Grove, depicting its foundation.

Narrator: *'By claw and tooth, from root to thorn,<br>The Old Oak's grove, to wildlings sworn.'*
: True
Narrator: *The mural shows druids claiming the grove in the name of the Old Oak - Silvanus, god of nature.*

----- Session: VB_LockedLibrary -----
Synopsis: Player tries to open a stone door, but it's just a blank slab. There's no place for a key.

Player: I can't even see a lock to pick.

----- Session: VB_ObtainedReward -----
Synopsis: Player finds a glaive in a locked room. Reading a nearby book you might learn it was taken from the Shadow cursed lands by Halsin, who found it was infused with dark power. (It does have a special power - the glaive deals 1d6 extra necrotic damage to characters UNLESS they're standing in sunlight.)

Player: The glaive the druid's notebook mentioned. Its owner thought it was cursed... || [context] NodeContext: (Astarion: with a little relish)

======== Scenario: den_stargazing ========
Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Nadira is a witty tiefling that survived Avernus and escaped with a soul coin, a valuable currency of the Hells. She suspects the player works for the original owner of the coin, a devilish erinyes, and will have to be persuaded in order to hand it over.

Nadira: You have good timing. Never been much of a fighter, so wrestling a bugbear would have gone poorly.
Nadira: But you're not here for heroics, are you? Avernus' stench is all over your skin.
Nadira: Let me guess: your devil mistress sent you to get her soul coin back. Too bad. I earned it fair and square.
Karlach: Oh man, a soul coin? Wouldn't mind getting my hands on that... || [context] NodeContext: Very interested but maybe downplaying her interest.
Player: That bugbear would have crushed your skull. This is the thanks I get?
Nadira: Why thank you, dread slayer of bugbears. You shall live forever in my memory. || [context] NodeContext: Dramatically exaggerated/sarcastic.
Nadira: Now take my regards back to that pouting erinyes and leave me alone. || [context] NodeContext: Very flat, almost cold.
Player: How about this? You give me the coin. Now.
Player: You hand the coin over, or I kill you. How about that?
: True
Nadira: Considering you turned that bugbear into paste... || [approval] ['Shadowheart 1', 'Karlach 1']
Nadira: ...that's a good trade. Except the coin seems to have slipped through a hole in my pocket somewhere. Damn it.

Derryth is a bit gruff - she's a healer, but her bedside manner leaves a lot to be desired. She's also a very shrewd businessperson. She's in the underdark to get rich first and foremost.
She treats her business partner (Baelen) like he's an idiot, and pretends not to care about him, but in reality he is the most important person to her in the world.

Derryth Bonecloak: Seems the 'shrooms are letting in more people every day. || [context] NodeContext: Not friendly. She's got a real squint in her eye taking you in.

Narrator: *You are swallowed by a chorus of turbulent music. Through one creature sing many voices: the harmony of an entire collective.*
Restless Myconid: ((*Sovereign. they have come. they are here*))

There's some reactivity depending on whether Baelen has returned to the bonecloak camp or not, and if Baelen recovered his senses by eating the noblestalk mushroom. The animal's observations reinforce that Baelen has been more amiable and gentle since his mind began to slip, and his recovery is not seen as a good thing by all.

Deep Rothé: Master sounds different, like old self. Angry self. Don't like. || [context] NodeContext: SWA line. Reproachful. A simple beast of burden senses his master has returned to a crueler demeanour.

 Next block: you have killed all the duergars; now it wants you to kill the sovereign
. 
Final block: you have killed the sovereign and it rewards you. 

This myconid does not speak with the same hive mind voice of the others. He should sound creepy, like FART in Rick and Morty, with a SLIGHT undercurrent of menace.

 As the quest moves on, he gets more and more creepy and angry,

She's slowly succumbing to poison - initially vague and feverish. If we heal her, she's exhausted but straight back on task, giving us the job of freeing her people.

Thulla: No need for me to ask how you fared - some of my kin have already made it here, safe and sound. || [context] NodeContext: A little more relaxed than we've seen her - eyeing us up and impressed with what she sees

----- Session: SocietyOfBrilliance_MindFlayer -----

Omeluum: I greet you, child of the sun. How has your search for the mushrooms fared?
Omeluum: I greet you, sun child.
Player: How do you survive? Don't you need... brains?
Omeluum: In the beginning, I had an arrangement with a lich. Excellent company, despite what one would expect.
Omeluum: I required brains, he required souls. A perfect symbiosis.
Omeluum: But our ambitions eventually splintered. I wished to better the world, and he preferred its rot.
Omeluum: So I left his company, and thus I now feed from those who... act against the Society's goals.
Player: Best way to deal with that sort of hunger, I suppose.
Omeluum: Perhaps the peoples of the Underdark will be less inclined to violence if they comprehend the cost, yes?
Omeluum: I greet you, sun child.
Player: I'd like to learn more about the tadpole.<br> || [approval] ['Karlach 1']
Narrator: *An almost childlike joy enters Omeluum's ichor-laced eyes.*

Lunkbug: Beldron - thank Ironhand! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Addressed to Beldron
Beldron: We ought to thank someone a little closer by, I think. || [context] NodeContext: Tired, wry - referencing the player when his husband thanks the gods
Beldron: Gaerdal Ironhand you may not be, but you damn well fight like him. || [context] NodeContext: Impressed with you - someone thanked the war-god Ironhand and he's implying you're the next best thing
Beldron: I'm grateful, don't mistake me, but... why help us? You're one of them, aren't you? || [context] NodeContext: Guarded, sizing the player up - he thinks we're one of the cultists
Player: Are you always so suspicious of those who save you?
Beldron: I try not to need saving. Hasn't much worked out, as you can see. || [context] NodeContext: Self-deprecating
Beldron: You did just lift a mountain from our heads, so... good enough for me, I reckon. || [context] NodeContext: Nodding, accepting - not going to look a gift horse in the mouth

With Wulbren gone, that falls to me. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Standard 'handing reward' animation.NodeContext: Drawing himself up to perform a necessary obligation - doesn't see himself as leadership material but accepts the responsibility
Barcus Wroot: Make it quick! We need to find Wulbren - now.

Beldron: No. Debt's a stone 'round your neck, and we Ironhands like to walk tall. We'll be fine. || [context] NodeContext: Gently firm - too proud not to give you a reward
Beldron: It's Wulbren I'm worried for. He was sent on to Moonrise Towers.
Beldron: We were just slave-hands to the cult, but not Wulbren. He... knows things. Things they want to know too. || [context] NodeContext: Hesitant to say exactly what Wulbren knows
Barcus Wroot: What has he gotten himself mixed up in now...
Player: Before you ask, no - I'm not going to stage a rescue.
Beldron: Aye. Nor us, I'm afraid. || [context] NodeContext: shrugging, a little defeated. This line trails off into another 'Much as I want to march after Wulbren myself... we can't.'
Beldron: We have our own freedom to look to, I'm afraid. We'll take our chance when it arises, then back to the city. || [context] NodeContext: His people are still enslaved - he needs to be pragmatic.
Beldron: Wulbren knew the risks when he came in search of runepowder. We all did.

----- Session: Saved -----
Synopsis: Dialog for gnome foreman on the other side of the ebon lake after they were saved by player. Mentions the other gnomes being kept at moonrise towers.

Beldron: Thanks again for offing that drow. Only made it here 'cause of you. But I can't stop thinking about the rest of us...
Beldron: ... stuck in Moonrise with a bunch of sadists. Poor bastards.

--- Scenario Details ---
======== Scenario: for_priestoftheconqueringgod ========
Session Sequence: Cultists -> Cultist002_Dead -> AD_OwlbearDead
----- Session: Cultists -----
Synopsis: The party encounters two novices of the Absolute , attending to a True Soul who had been leading them through the region. He now lies injured, but recognises us as having been tadpoled. He tells his novices that we are trustworthy, but they aren't so sure. We can convince them to do as we order, and tell them to leave the area or else set out to find the creature that attacked their True Soul leader.

Brynna: You're a True Soul. You can't die. Please stay with us. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The true soul is dying, laying on the ground, injured.
Andrick: I don't think he's conscious. Can you hear us, Ed? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Brynna turns toward the player.
Brynna: You! Not a step closer.
Narrator: *A strange symbol glows, marked on their flesh, and something within you stirs in response.*
Player: What happened to your friend?
Andrick: An owlbear. Please, do you have any -
Brynna: Shut up, Andrick! Do you serve the Absolute?
Edowin: Wait.
Narrator: *The injured man locks eyes with you. A familiar squirming churns in your head.*
Player: Move away, reaching for your weapon.
Narrator: *Your limbs do not obey. Your minds intertwine. You see his siblings - Andrick and Brynna. New recruits. Yours to shepherd.*
Edowin: Protect them.
Edowin: They are a True Soul. Mind them. They will - they - they... || [context] CinematicNodeContext: *Huddock smiled before falling still with a final, bloody wheeze of air.*NodeContext: Validated - he thought he sensed a likeminded individual, and was proven correct. Right on the verge of losing consciousness from his injuries. he dies after saying this.
Andrick: Edowin. Ed! Please! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Andrick drops his weapon and kneels beside Edowin.NodeContext: Andrick drops his weapon and kneels beside Edowin.
Brynna: He's with the Absolute now. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The cultists pause for an extra moment here before continuing the dialogue, to properly acknowledge the true soul's passing.NodeContext: Sad, mourning air
Brynna: You're... you're a True Soul. Edowin, our brother - he was chosen. Like you. || [context] NodeContext: Still sad from brother dying. Trying to be strong.
Brynna: Do you have orders for us? We were reporting to Edowin. || [context] NodeContext: Hopeful for guidance, sad remembering her brother. We WERE reporting to Edowin, but... he just died.
Player: Leave.
Andrick: Wait! Please - don't leave us. What should we do now...? || [context] NodeContext: Clingy. The cult novice pleads for orders from the player, whom he believes to be a superior.

----- Session: Cultist002_Dead -----
Synopsis: Novice Brynna, a junior member of the cult of the Absolute, is dead. Here, the player casts a spell to grant limited and temporary resurrection for the purpose of questioning her. From her, they can learn more about the cult's hierarchy, specfically the meaning of the 'True Soul' rank that is frequently referred to. Her ability to communicate after death is limited - cryptic, broken or repetitive answers to a small range of questions. If she recognises her killer, she can refuse to answer or else lie.

Narrator: *The corpse regards you lifelessly.*
Player: Who are you?
Brynna: Brynna... a faithful... servant to... the Absolute...

----- Session: AD_OwlbearDead -----
Synopsis: Two cult novices express jubilation as their leader successfully kills a dangerous wild beast that killed their brother.

Andrick: That was amazing! || [context] NodeContext: Elated and fawning.
Brynna: We did it. For Edowin. And the Absolute. || [context] NodeContext: Amazed and jubilant. She just witnessed her superior slay a dangerous beast.

----- Session: VB_DiscoverPriests -----
Synopsis: Player spots the wounded True Soul and his minions, is wary about what's going on.

Brynna: Hang on, Ed. You're going to be all right. || [context] NodeContext: One of the cult acolytes vocalises what both of them are thinking: the comrade they're praying for looks on the verge of death.
Andrick: He's so pale. || [context] NodeContext: The first acolyte clings to his faith. Easier than planning a contingency.
Brynna: Stop it. You're scaring him. || [context] NodeContext: The second acolyte continues to press her point, uncertain of what comes next for them.
Andrick: You're all right, Ed. You're all right. || [context] NodeContext: The first acolyte loses his patience. Prayer is the best strategy he has for now - he wasn't expecting to have to call the shots.

Session Sequence: LastCub ->  -> PAD_HealedOwlbear -> VB_CubResolution_2P
----- Session: LastCub -----
Synopsis: In SwA, this cub speaks in short bursts - he sounds staccato, vicious.The player has killed an owlbear - a large, predatory wild animal. The owlbear's cub remains however, and lingers by his dead mother. The player can decide whether to put the cub out of its misery, or else leave it. If the player has the speak with animals skill, they get some additional insight into the cub's anxiety. If the player lets the cub live, it will proceed to eat its mother - it's still a wild animal, after all.

Narrator: *The cub looks from you to his dead mother.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The cub looks from dead mother to the player, wailing.NodeContext: Narrator node!
Owlbear Cub: *Braawww!*

----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: In SwA, the owlbear speaks like a human. Her voice is deep and threatening - the voice of a seasoned fighter, at home in a fight and used to winning. However, she knows she's injured and at a disadvantage, but refuses to betray that to the player. Doing so might encourage the player to attack, putting her cub in danger.The player stumbles upon the nest of an owlbear; a large, predatory hybrid creature. They find themselves in a stand-off against the beast - if they get too close or act aggressively, it attacks. If they keep cool and back off when the opportunity presents itself, the owlbear will let them leave. The player may also notice that the owlbear is wounded - a broken spear protrudes from one eye socket. They may notice that the owlbear has a cub - this is the main reason for her aggression and territoriality.Additional note 1: the player may stumble upon this scenario by themselves, or they may have been pointed in the right direction after meeting some cultists who had a close encounter with the owlbear. If we won these cultists over, they may be available to fight the owlbear at our side.Additional note 2: If the owlbear mother is killed but her cub survives, we can decide the juvenile's fate. If we spare it, we may later find it being used for sport by the goblins in their camp.

Narrator: *You feel the quake of its heavy footsteps before you see it: an owlbear, its beaked face looming out of the darkness.*
Owlbear: What's this? Something weak, something tender... || [context] NodeContext: Sizing up the player.
Owlbear: Won't even have to chew you before I feed you to my son, softmeat.
Player: Sorry - wrong cave. I'll be going.
Owlbear: I don't think so. You've seen my nest. You've seen my cub.
Owlbear: That makes you dangerous. An easy meal.
Owlbear: The meat tastes better when it's afraid.
Player: Just allow me to leave. I'm no threat to you or your cub.
: False
Owlbear: You'll be even less of a threat when you're in pieces. || [approval] ["Lae'zel 1", 'Shadowheart -1', 'Karlach -1']

----- Session: PAD_HealedOwlbear -----
Synopsis: A short VB after player heals the Owlbear in gameplay. Owlbear is still dangerous, though. This can happen either before or after the player has interacted with Owlbear. It's meant to give feedback on the fact that the owlbear is now healed, but not to encourage the player to provoke her.

Player: Healed - but she doesn't look much happier. || [context] NodeContext: Karlach: 'I healed you, owlbear--> you still look like you're gonna rip my face off.'

Player: You're a little far from home for a deep gnome.
Barcus Wroot: Ignorance is alive and well, it seems! Deep gnomes aren't restricted to the Underdark, you know - I've lived in Baldur's Gate for years. || [context] NodeContext: Testily
Barcus Wroot: I'm in search of a friend. I fear he's in trouble. He had this locket, see, that I gave him years ago before leaving home. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: He talks about the locket but doesn't have it on him to show the player
Barcus Wroot: I found it around the neck of a thug in Baldur's Gate. It was speckled with blood, my friend nowhere to be found. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: He talks about the locket but doesn't have it on him to show the player
Barcus Wroot: But I still have hope. I have reason to believe he's in the Underdark. Hopefully I'll pick up his trail from there. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: He talks about the locket but doesn't have it on him to show the player
Barcus Wroot: I always help my friends. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Looks player up and down judgementally, player should wonder 'is he talking about me?'InternalNodeContext: He hasn't given player the pack yet.

Player: What's in it for me? || [context] NodeContext: Incredulous. His good samaritan seems to be haggling for a reward before even freeing him.

--- Scenario Details ---
======== Scenario: hag_hagambush ========
Session Sequence: PAD_SidedHag
----- Session: PAD_SidedHag -----
Synopsis: This VB plays after saving Ethel from the two brothers of the sister she's holding captive. Ether disappeared in a magic puff, and she was acting suspicious. The players are reacting to her exit and discussing that there may be more to Ethel than meets the eye.Speaker 1 may have been the character who was in dialog for the scene with Ethel. Speaker 2 is another party member. However, since there may be combat, this setup isn't guaranteed and it's best to write this assuming everyone had a hand in the actions that led to this VB playing.

Player: Bloody way to end an argument. I hope we chose the right side.
Player: No point in debating what's already done. Let's go on ahead.

Session Sequence: PAD_TadpoleDivine
----- Session: PAD_TadpoleDivine -----
Synopsis: This VB plays after attempting to get Ethel to remove the tadpole. She confesses that there's something special about it and she can't remove it.Will play on the player who leaves the dialog that reveals this fact, but characters can be fairly opinionated here since they are reacting to knowledge.Up to two characters.

Player: The tadpole was tampered with? That complicates things...
Player: Tampered or not, we need to get these things out of our heads. Let's find another way.

She's charismatic and friendly, in a crude sort of way, but has an underlying suspicion and curiosity.

The voice orders the player to help the three find the Orpheus artefact and to seek 'the path of illumination'.If a party member in the group has the Orpheus box in their inventory, they take it into their hands. It glows brighter and brighter, and then the voice and visions stop. The light from the box then fades, and the player(s) discuss the apparent protection the box provided from the Absolute’s influence.If no party member in the group has the Orpheus box in their inventory,and Shadowheart isn't alive to show up, the visions and voice will cause the party to pass out and experience a forced camp night where they receive the box.NOTE: this dialogue contains narrator nodes that're intended to be player-forward in the medium term until NPC assets are available for cinematics.

Roah Moonglow: Till this crowd converted and started sending their captives to Moonrise Towers, at least. || [context] NodeContext: Correcting herself. Tone is rueful - some of her best trading partners have fallen to organised religion.
Roah Moonglow: No complaints, mind - I just sold enough smokepowder to cover the loss ten times over. || [context] NodeContext: Perking up - she still managed to make a profit. Always a bright side.

Roah Moonglow: Ask the drow they're all bowing to. That glint in her eye is bad news for someone. || [context] NodeContext: Shrug - it's not her problem, but she pities whoever the drow is planning to deal with.
Roah Moonglow: Not my concern, so long as I'm paid. Speaking of - something to trade, or what? || [context] NodeContext: Shrugging, getting back to the matter at hand. She's used to minding her own business - and everything is just business to her.

----- Session: PAD_EnteringGoblinCamp -----
Synopsis: Thematically, this VB is a conversation about the goblin camp and how difficult it might be to find the druid there. Player will be aware that he's being held captive somewhere in the camp and can see the goblins's strength.This occurs over walking into a trigger, so lines between speaker 1 and speaker 2 can be fairly opinionated.

Player: The druid Halsin is in here somewhere.
Player: Let's hope we find him in one piece.

--- Scenario Details ---
======== Scenario: hag_hag ========
Session Sequence: AD_TeleportSurrogateMother
----- Session: AD_TeleportSurrogateMother -----
Synopsis: Fires as the hag grabs Mayrina and teleports to the lair OR Hag is injured and disappears from the fight alone.

: Come now, Mayrina! Time to go. || [context] InternalNodeContext: Leaving with Mayrina, i.e. outside of combat.
: Bye-bye, lovelies. || [context] InternalNodeContext: Mayrina & hag leave together, Hag is not in combatNodeContext: Mocking tone and wave as you taunt the player.

======== Scenario: hag_hagambush ========
Session Sequence: AD_HagDisappear -> Brother_001_AD_Fallback -> ThankPlayer -> Confrontation
----- Session: AD_HagDisappear -----
Synopsis: AD that fires as the Hag disappears during the ambush.

: Bye-bye, my lovelies! || [context] NodeContext: You've disappeared into thin air. A mocking goodbye.

----- Session: Brother_001_AD_Fallback -----
Synopsis: Player tries to speak to the brother while either the other brother is in the shared Brothers dialogue (and this one missed it for some reason), or because they're waiting for the hag to come back into the house and start her dialogue.

Demir: Hm? || [context] NodeContext: Looking around, scared but trying not to show it.

----- Session: ThankPlayer -----
Synopsis: This dialogue occurs if the player has sided with the hag in the ambush and saved her - by killing the brothers.
She's still in old lady mode, hamming up how upset she is, but there should be a hint on the last set of questions, about the gold, that this was an act and that there is more to her than meets the eye.

: Oh, my stars. || [context] NodeContext: Player has just saved Ethel. This is exactly what she hoped would happen. Still playing up the old lady act -upset and frazzled and overcome with emotion.
: I - I didn't mean for this to happen. || [context] NodeContext: Ibid.
Player: Do you know this 'Mayrina' they mentioned?
: She's their little sister. And... she's staying with me. || [context] NodeContext: You've just admitted that two men have died because you lied. You're acting like heartbroken and upset, when this was always your plan
: This is all my fault. But I made a promise! || [context] NodeContext: Pleading, emphasising promise.
: Mayrina begged me not to breathe a word if they came looking for her. And my word is my bond. || [context] NodeContext: Seems genuinely upset - pleasing for understanding.
: That poor thing will be distraught. We can't let her know - it'd break her poor heart.
: I'd best get going, but please stop by my house. I'd like to thank you proper.

----- Session: Confrontation -----
Synopsis: Auntie Ethel has been cornered by two brothers - Demir and Johl - who claim Ethel is a hag and has taken their sister. Ethel is pleading that she has no idea what they're talking about and begs the player to help her.Ethel is actually a hag. Should we step back and do thing, she summons monsters to cut the two brothers down. Should we side with her, we have to kill the brothers. Should we side with the brothers, Ethel is angry and disappears with a threat.

: Lads, for the love of all that is holy, I've never clapped eyes on your poor sister. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Looking at the brothers - hasn't noticed the player yet. NodeContext: Opening line of the dialogue. Annoyed as you plead with the two men who advance on you. You sound sincere and genuine.
Johl: Drop the act, hag. You was the last to see Mayrina. || [context] NodeContext: Not buying Auntie Ethel's claim that she hasn't seen Mayrina. Accusation and fury in your voice - you're prepared to get violent if needs be.
Demir: Just let her go. Please. || [context] NodeContext: Your brother is on the brink of violence and you're trying to regain control of the situation. You just want your baby sister back, you don't want anyone to get hurt.
: You there! Please, I don't know what's come over these boys. I just want to go home. || [context] NodeContext: You've caught sight of the player. You call out, fear and pleading in your voice - in your mind you've hatched a plan - you're going to force the player to defend you and kill the brothers.

======== Scenario: hag_well ========
Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: This well sits just outside of the hag's teahouse. When the player drinks from it, they feel a rush of power and gain a positive status (regardless of whether the illusion is up or down). However, once they enter combat with the hag, it turns to poison in their veins.

Narrator: *A fetid smell assaults your nostrils. Dead flesh lies below - a great deal of it.* || [context] NodeContext: The well is disgusting and well
Narrator: *Fresh, sweet-smelling water gurgles gently below.* || [context] NodeContext: Soft and idyllic description of the well
Player: Drink from the well.
Narrator: *The warm rush of power flows through you. You feel stronger, faster - better.* || [context] NodeContext: Occurs after drinking from the well || [approval] ['Gale 1', "Lae'zel 1"]

======== Scenario: hag_gurhunter ========
Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Male, middle-age or older.Gandrel is a monster hunter we encounter outside the Hag's lair. He's pleasant, cheerful, and a little eccentric - but shows his experience and expertise when warning us about the hag. He's affable and unassuming, but shows moments of steel when discussing his quarry (Astarion). A younger General Iroh from Avatar is a good reference - someone who makes you feel good about yourself just by conversing with you.

Gandrel: Ah, a fellow wanderer. Forgive the aroma. || [context] NodeContext: Friendly - noticing a stranger, wryly apologising for the slight stench
Narrator: *You catch a waft of something foul - metallic and sickly-sweet.*
Gandrel: Powdered iron-vine. Most monsters will think twice before making a meal of me. || [context] NodeContext: Explaining the smell in the air - he's taken a foul substance designed to ward off monsters
Gandrel: An old hunter's trick - if you can't mask your scent, spoil it. || [context] NodeContext: Friendly, unassuming, as if what he's saying is perfectly conventional
Player: Whatever you're hunting, your stench alone will kill it.
Gandrel: Hah! A quick wit is rare indeed. Good manners, however, all beings can aspire to. || [context] NodeContext: We've just insulted him and he's absolutely unfazed. Second line is simply polite advice.
Gandrel: I suggest you find yours before dealing with the lady of this house. || [context] NodeContext: Advising with only a slight hint of admonishment
Gandrel: A sharp wit will serve you better, if you're to bargain with the lady of this house.
Gandrel: That is why you come to her lair, I take it? To bargain? || [context] NodeContext: Gently prodding for our story
Player: 'The lady of this house'?
Gandrel: A more innocent name than some I could call her. But it is what she is that ought to concern you.
Gandrel: Her kind have hidden among us since the first darkness - and their knowledge is matched only by their spite. || [context] NodeContext: Growing slightly grave - telling us of a great evil thing that is not to be underestimated
Gandrel: Know how to ask, and they'll share that knowledge. If you're fool enough to pay their price. || [context] NodeContext: Telling us the risk might be worth the reward - but is is a great risk
Player: I think you're mistaken - this place looks innocent enough.
Gandrel: That would be nice. I'd welcome a proper cup of tea.
Gandrel: But I'm not wrong. Take her lightly, and she'll serve up your eyes for appetisers.
Gandrel: I'll eat them, too. I need her knowledge - the thing I hunt has gone to ground. || [context] NodeContext: Only faintly apologetic - he wishes us no harm, but he needs the hag and her information
Gandrel: But she thrives on suffering. Once she hears what awaits my quarry when I catch him, she will help. || [context] NodeContext: Growing grave
Player: Any advice on how to deal with her?
Gandrel: Scream. Turn. Run the other way - that's what I'd like to say.
Gandrel: But bad as she is, I'm betting whatever drove you to her door is worse.
Gandrel: So instead: know you're outmatched. Know what you're willing to give. And mind your manners.

======== Scenario: hag_hagspawn ========
Session Sequence: ResurrectHusband -> SurrogateMother_AD_HagOccupied -> AD_HagSurrogateMotherStartScene -> AD_HusbandGrave -> SurrogateMother_AD_CorpseDugUp -> PAD_AfterResurrection
----- Session: ResurrectHusband -----
Synopsis: The player has discovered a wand that will allow them to raise Mayrina's husband from the dead. Mayrina is standing by the coffin that holds her dead husband. When player raises Connor from the dead, the coffin door bursts open and he crawls out of it a zombie - unable to speak in anything other than moans and groans. Player can take the zombie as a summon, kill the zombie, or give the zombie to Mayrina.

Mayrina: Gods, didn't hear you coming. I know I should head home, but I can't bring myself to leave. || [context] NodeContext: look up from quietly crying, surprised
Mayrina: The thought of putting him in a wheelbarrow and making the journey all over again... *Sigh.* || [context] NodeContext: turns back to the grave, arms crossed - then gestures to the coffin. Trying not to cry.
Player: I could say a prayer, if you'd like.
Mayrina: Please. Connor used to say only a fool turned down the divine. || [context] NodeContext: Sincere. Grateful. Trying not to cry.
Player: Light wanes only to wax again - and though life fades, memory shall not.
Mayrina: He'd have liked that. Thanks. || [context] NodeContext: Player has said a prayer that has made you feel much better. Sincere thanks as you hold back tears.

----- Session: SurrogateMother_AD_HagOccupied -----
Synopsis: This is an edgecase in which the player talks to Mayrina when the hag isn't present. Mayrina is afraid, looking around for the hag - doesn't want to get into trouble. Sitting down in her chair.

Mayrina: Quick. Get out of here. She won't like me talking to you. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Sitting down in her chair - looking at her foodNodeContext: Afraid - looking around for the hag. Head low.

----- Session: AD_HagSurrogateMotherStartScene -----
Synopsis: This fires between Mayrina and the Hag in the teahouse before the player has spoken to either of them.

Mayrina: You've a face on you that could turn milk, petal. || [context] NodeContext: Sing song voice - cheery.
Mayrina: A walk would cheer me up. || [context] NodeContext: You ask this tentatively. You're desperate to go outside but don't want to upset Ethel.
: Hush, now! Won't be discussing that again. || [context] NodeContext: Smile as you dismiss the girl's request to leave. Cheery.

----- Session: AD_HusbandGrave -----
Synopsis: This occurs above the grave of Connor, Mayrina's husband. It was written by the hag and is a cruel jab.

Player: 'Here lies Connor - beloved husband, and a tasty little morsel to boot.' || [context] NodeContext: Above a gravestone - a cruel jab.

----- Session: SurrogateMother_AD_CorpseDugUp -----
Synopsis: Triggers when Mayrina gets to the grave. In the top node the grave is empty. In the bottom the corpse is lying there for her to see. She leaves and does not return.

Mayrina: What? Someone's taken Connor? || [context] NodeContext: Horrified
Mayrina: I dragged my husband here in a wheelbarrow. Buried him. Took everything the hag threw at  me for him. || [context] NodeContext: Mounting anger and grief
Mayrina: And some godsdamned psychopath digs him up? I hate this place. I hate everyone. || [context] NodeContext: Mounting anger and grief

----- Session: PAD_AfterResurrection -----
Synopsis: The player's found a wand in the Hag's lair and tried to use it to resurrect Mayrina's husband. Unfortunately, it was cursed and he only came back a zombie. The players reflect on using items from evil beings.

Player: Not quite the outcome intended, but I must say - the technique was excellent.
Player: The spell is cast - what's done is done.

======== Scenario: hag_murderousfrog ========
Session Sequence: 
======== Scenario: hag_forestillusion ========
Session Sequence: IllusionRedcap
----- Session: IllusionRedcap -----
Synopsis: This occurs in the swamp. Sheep wander the area - except they're redcaps (a type of violent faerie) hidden by the hag's illusions. The creatures are pretending to be sheep. 
The illusion can be shattered by an animal handling check. OR if the player preciously succeeded in a perception check in the area.

Narrator: *A diminutive creature sporting a red hat glares at you.*
: True
Narrator: *You recognise the redcap - a fey creature known for its bloodlust.*
Redcap Blood Sage, Redcap, Redcap Blood Sage, 0446e7c4-3076-415c-aa7f-deb7f43e5d06, Redcap, a72e6051-d06b-469c-b6dc-4c962cfe307f: Argh.

----- Session: Flind -----
Synopsis: The flind is the leader of a pack of gnolls. Normally, these monsters hunger for flesh and eat anything, but the flind has been infected with a mind flayer's tadpole (like the players) and this has created an internal 'Voice' that guides it toward certain meat, forbidding others. The forbidden meats are those that work for the mind flayers - including the players - leading to a telepathic 'dialogue' when the flind restrains itself from attacking and calls off its pack.

We can attempt to overpower the Flind psionically, allowing us to control it temporarily in order to destroy the pack of gnolls. If we choose to fight the Flind, we should be prepared for a difficult encounter. It is strong, though far from the most powerful of its kind thanks to the war raging in its brain.

Narrator: *She is still ravenous, her mind a hungry pit. The flesh of her pack wasn't enough to satisfy her.* || [context] NodeContext: 'she' is a monstrous gnoll - it is hungry for the player's flesh. Anxiety in the player's voice

Narrator: *You taste the blood in her throat, feel it pooling in the cavity of her skull. But she still resists.* || [context] NodeContext: growing anxiety - feeling resistance of a wounded enemy through a psychic connection
Player: Harness your willpower, and order her to devour herself.
: True
Narrator: *Your tadpole wriggles, contented, as she tears out her own throat.* || [context] NodeContext: watching a beast - the flind - preparing to devour itself. We commanded her to do this, but it's still horrifying || [approval] ['Astarion 1', 'Gale 1']

----- Session: Freed -----
Synopsis: Benryn finds himself faced with multiple crises in this dialogue. When the player finds him, he is frantic and coughing, trapped beneath a collapsed beam within a burning building. If the player rescues him, he frantically and desperately searches for his wife, who was outside when a band of goblins and drow attacked the inn they were staying at. Finally, if the player finds his wife's body, he is heartbroken - he believes her death is his fault, because of a silly argument that they had.

When players first encounter Benryn, he is trapped beneath a heavy beam in a burning building. If the player helps him escape, Benryn joins the party until they exit the building safely. Once outside, Benryn is in shock at the carnage around him - bodies of goblins and humans litter the inn's courtyard. He snaps out of his shock when he thinks of his wife, who was outside when the raiding party arrived. He pleads for the player to help him find her - when players do, she is already dead. Pointed to her body, Benryn breaks down - the weight of guilt immediately crushing him.
