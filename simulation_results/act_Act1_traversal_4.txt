Okta: The smell doesn't matter. It's food in their bellies. || [context] NodeContext: sounds slightly grumpy and defensive of your food
: Why, you can't call something food if it doesn't smell good - cooking is an art, petal. || [context] NodeContext: Faux outrage and slightly condescending.

If she's healed, she is ready for a fight and eager to prove herself and protect those she loved. If she paralyzed, she just wants the player to protect the other tieflings - she's convinced she'll die. If she survives, she thanks the player - knowing it is directly because of them that she survived.

Dammon: The goblins will run us through unless I get them mended.
Player: How are you managing to forge anything out here?
Dammon: When Elturel fell into Avernus, I was drafted into an infernal forge. Learned a few techniques for making a lot out of a little.
Dammon: Between you and me, there's nothing in all the realms like the utter power of infernal machinery. Can't replicate it outside the Hells. Probably for the best.

2) Child escapes. M is frustrated that the child fled 'without punishment'. He believes the other tieflings will take this as a sign that they can be walked all over. L isn't so sure.

Marcoryl: I pray the tieflings realise we are not to be trifled with.
Loic: I just hope they leave, and we can close this grove in peace.
Marcoryl: And if it comes to a fight? You'll not shy away from bloodshed I hope.
Loic: Since when did we become killers?
Marcoryl: Since they forced our hand.

Synopsis: In these dialogues, Zevlor reflects on what's happened (an attack of goblins at the gate, which the player helped with) and his mistrust of and bitterness towards the druids who are reluctantly hosting his people. He is exasperated, furious, but also eager to meet anyone who could help. In the same dialogue, we can also uncover that he is in fact a traitor, concerned only with getting these people through the goblins so he can trade them for his own safety later. In truth he is resentful and contemptuous of them, viewing them as weak.

Narrator: *Confusion crosses Zevlor's eyes as he takes you in.*
Player: I figured I was due a makeover. What do you think?

Zevlor: You'll find the druids at the heart of the grove. Please - make them see sense, before more lives are lost.
Zevlor: Oh, and if it's of any concern... you're brave to walk around without hiding your heritage. I'll make sure everyone knows that you helped us at the gate. || [context] NodeContext: Addressing an awkward topic before he forgets - most would run from your race on sight, but he's reassuring us that we're welcome

Volo: A few questions, if you please. There's no overstating my interest. || [context] NodeContext: He wants to write down what you'll say. Enthusiastic.
Player: Fine - ask your questions.
Volo: Glory! Now, then: || [context] CinematicNodeContext: He's ready to write, quill to book.NodeContext: Player agreed to answer his questions. He's happy but also arrogant, like a rich old person saying 'you're an absolute DOLL' when you do a minor favor for them.
Volo: How would you describe that particular batch of goblins? Size? Nature? Distinguishing qualities? || [context] NodeContext: Quizzing the player, looking for info for his book. He's more professional here, curious.
: True
Narrator: *You search your mind, successfully recalling various details of goblin behaviour.*
Player: Common variety goblins, led by a lasher and flanked by booyahgs.
Volo: My! A scholar after my own heart. Spent much time among goblins?
Player: The time was spent among books. I'm a student of the page. || [approval] ['Gale 1']
Volo: Aha! I've always preferred experience to the second-hand accounts of lesser men. But to each their own!
Volo: Now I've a few more questions, if you don't mind.
Volo: And the... dragon they had marching in the rear. Was it of the brass or silver variety? || [context] NodeContext: Volo is bullshitting. There was no dragon and he knows it. But he's stating it to the player as though he believes it.
Player: Dragon...? There wasn't any dragon.
Volo: 'Witnesses... failed... to... notice the... obvious... dragon...' || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Scribbling in notebookNodeContext: Response to 'I told him there was no dragon.' Volo's sensationalizing again.
Volo: Last question, then you'll be quite free. Did the attackers rally to 'the Absolute' when they fell upon the gates? || [context] NodeContext: He's wrapping things up, in full journalism mode.
Player: Yes - they called out the name like a war cry.
Volo: They did, didn't they? Oh-ho, curious. Curious indeed. || [context] NodeContext: Answers that yes, the goblins used the word 'Absolute'. He's very interested in this; very intrigued. Your confirmation is exactly what he wanted to hear.
Volo: I've interrogated one - a captive in this very camp. She reports they've abandoned their god Maglubiyet in favour of someone called 'the Absolute'.
Volo: The scandal! || [context] NodeContext: Hissed like he's just conveyed a very juicy bit of gossip
Player: Goblin superstition - not worth the ink and parchment.

----- Session: Bear -----
Synopsis: Bear in the druid grove. This is a Speak with Animals dialogue. If Volo is there, we sense his frustration at trying to communicate with Volo (who has been asking him questions in an AD). If Volo isn't there, he wants to know who we are. He gets scared of us when we tell him about the tadpole.

Bosk: Just a moment - this man is recording my story.
Bosk: I. Am. Far. From. Home. || [context] NodeContext: Articulating very clearly - he's trying to make someone who can't speak with animals understand what he's saying.
Narrator: *As the colourful man starts scribbling, the bear sneaks a quick look at the page.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Volo is excited, writing on the page. The bear leans in to see what he's writing.
Narrator: *His brow furrows. Incomprehensible squiggles surround a crude sketch: a bear disembowelling a clutch of tieflings.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Bear leans away, disappointed.

Synopsis: Maggran (druid guarding the entrance to the inner sanctum of the Emerald Grove) is in bear form. He delivers curt, bestial one-liners if the player has speak with animals. He doesn't want them around. He has a lone human fallback line should he somehow transform.

It is easier to deal with fury then it is to temper fear. Locke is more level-headed but no less close to violence. Marrick and Locke are both at the entrance to the inner grove and the sacred pool and have just been denied entry.

Komira: Unless you have news of Arabella I don't want to hear it. || [context] NodeContext: You still don't know if your daughter is okay. Tense and irritated - snapping a little though you don't mean to. You're just worried.
Player: Kagha will release her soon, just hold on. || [approval] ['Astarion 1', 'Shadowheart 1', 'Karlach -1']
Komira: Bloody when?! || [context] NodeContext: Player has just said your daughter will be released 'soon'. Snapping and frustrated. You need to see here and you're terrified for her.

On success, they realise that the Harpers would be smart enough not to leave their stash in plain sight - the goal of this hint is to deter the player from interacting with the mimics in the area and to instead look around for a hidden stash somewhere

Player: Must be in one of these chests.

----- Session: DwarvenAlchemist -----
Synopsis: Derryth is a dwarven alchemist visiting the underdark from Baldur's Gate. She runs a shop in the city with Baelen, her business partner. They've come to the underdark in search of a very valuable mushroom - noblestalk. When the player arrived, she was tending to an injured gnome.
Derryth is a bit gruff - she's a healer, but her bedside manner leaves a lot to be desired. She's also a very shrewd businessperson. She's in the underdark to get rich first and foremost.
She treats her business partner (Baelen) like he's an idiot, and pretends not to care about him, but in reality he is the most important person to her in the world.

Derryth Bonecloak: Just leave me, I said. You've done enough damage already.
Derryth Bonecloak: You don't know what you've done. Leave me be. || [context] NodeContext: Player cured Baelen. She's facing a terrible future.
Player: I know exactly what I've done. Very entertaining. || [approval] ['Wyll -1', 'Karlach -1']

There's some reactivity depending on whether Baelen has returned to the bonecloak camp or not, and if Baelen recovered his senses by eating the noblestalk mushroom.

.

This myconid does not speak with the same hive mind voice of the others. He should sound creepy, like FART in Rick and Morty, with a SLIGHT undercurrent of menace.

 As the quest moves on, he gets more and more creepy and angry,

Session Sequence: SpeakWithBOOOAL -> KuoToaMinion -> AD_GodDead
----- Session: SpeakWithBOOOAL -----
Synopsis: The player encounters a group of kuo-toa, humanoid fish beings capable of creating gods just by imagining them. They're overzealous and easily duped, and are currently worshipping a murderous redcap they've mistaken for a god of murder. He's capitalising on the situation and very much enjoying the incredible power with which he's been invested. In this dialogue, we can deal with him as this great inscrutable power, or see through the situation and expose / do a deal with him. In all cases he's brash, offensive and generally gross.The all cap lines are BOOOAL in his fully powerful form.When we suddenly rever to lower caps, it's when we've forced him into his 'common' form.BOOOAL = Boo-AHHL (almost guttural)Kuo-Toa = Koo-oh-TO-ah

Pooldripp the Zealous: Our blood to fill your oceans, oh blessed BOOOAL! Our bones to build your temple in the deep! || [context] NodeContext: Fanatic devotion, speaking to the air/altar

Player: Bhaal is the true Lord of Murder. Perhaps I should offer you instead.
Pooldripp the Zealous: Bhaal...? No... we are... we are faithful to Lord BOOOAL... || [context] NodeContext: Confused, taken aback
Narrator: *You sense a flicker of doubt - brief, but enough. For an instant, the godly presence falters.*
BOOOAL: NO! NO! Stop that! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: BOOOAL is in the process of reverting back to his common form. He is invisible for "NO! NO" and becomes visible for "Stop that!"NodeContext: Furious, panicked - his con is being exposed and he's losing power even as he speaks
Player: He's a fabrication. Whatever you created him for, you don't need him.
: True
BOOOAL: ARGH! NO! SHUT IT! Shut your rotten mouth! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: BOOOAL is in the process of reverting back into his common form. He is invisible for the capitalised parts of this now, but then becomes visible for "Shut your rotten mouth"NodeContext: The lack of faith is literally draining power from him - sulky and furious all in one as he returns to his common form
Narrator: *You feel the presence waver - one moment a god of awesome power, the next... a common redcap.*
BOOOAL: Ah. Bollocks. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: BOOOAL is in his common form. He is no longer invisible, and he appears as a redacapNodeContext: Realising the game is up
BOOOAL: Don't do anything hasty, now. The fishfolk got plenty of power - we can share.<br> || [context] CinematicNodeContext: BOOOAL is in his common form. He is no longer invisible, and appears as a common redcapNodeContext: Still annoyed with us but willing to make a deal. Only SLIGHTLY wheedling - redcaps aren't known for negotiating
Pooldripp the Zealous: ... blessed Boooal... what...? || [context] NodeContext: Hesitant
BOOOAL: Shut it, you!  I'm talking to... my Chosen! Chosen got power - you want power, don't ya? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: BOOOAL is in his common form. He is no longer invisible, and just appears as an ordinary redcapNodeContext: Shouting his high priest down - he wants to seal the deal with us before his idiot followers fully catch on

Player: 'The Necromancy of Thay'? Sounds ominous.

----- Session: Tome -----
Synopsis: The player finds a book on necromancy - from one of the Red Wizards of Thay. Once read, the book will be bound to whoever tried to read it. Some origins will demand you let them read it, while others will want the book burned. If you read the book, you'll hear strange, distant whispers. The more you read, the stronger the voices will become, and the greater the chance that you'll be driven mad.

Narrator: *The book radiates power, but the words you read in the Codex echo in your mind, guiding your eyes safely across the page.*
Narrator: *The once-indecipherable glyphs now feel dangerously familiar, promising unholy power to those who can take it.*
Player: Read on and wrest the book's power from it.
: True
Narrator: *As you parse the strange glyphs, you can feel the book resisting. Ghostly voices whisper at you from the dark - probing and fighting your mind.*
Narrator: *But your will is iron and you brush past these shades of the past, devouring every secret the book has to offer.*
Narrator: *You see now, life and death are malleable as clay, to be bent and reshaped by your will. By your power.*
Narrator: *But as you close the book, a nagging doubt whispers in your mind. What consequences will there be for calling the dead from their rest?*

----- Session: PAD_PlayerTriedToTakeTome -----
Synopsis: Plays if the player tries to take DangerousBook (The Necromancy of Thay) out of their companion's inventory when the book is bound to that companion (and therefore locked to their inventory).

----- Session: Village_Trespassing -----
Synopsis: This guard has come upon you sneaking through a village her force is occupying. She was bored and sees you as a potential source of fun (ie, someone to murder/bully).  Defaulting to she, but numerous goblins could deliver this dialogue as it's a dynamic crime one.

Session Sequence:  -> AD -> TiedUp -> AD_UnfortunateGnomeFreed
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: The player speaks to a deep gnome after freeing him from some goblins, who'd had him tied to the sail of a windmill. The player discovers that the deep gnome travelled to the region as he learned his old friend is in danger. By way of thanks, he provides the player with the means to craft smokepowder, an explosive item. He then leaves for the Underdark in search of his friend. There, the player may encounter him again.

Barcus Wroot: Urrrgh... magga cammara - those pustulent thugs! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Cinematic/actor context - the deep gnome sways dizzilyNodeContext: 'Magga cammara' pronounced 'Mag-ah cam-ah-rah'. Gnomish exclamation meaning 'by the stones'.
Barcus the deep gnome is suffering some grogginess after spinning on the sail of a windmill for the last while.
Barcus Wroot: Well - get on with it. || [context] NodeContext: Still a little out of sorts after his ordeal spinning on a windmill, now a mixture of resigned and annoyed. He's expecting you to extort him now.
Player: You seem a little confused.
Player: Get on with what?
Barcus Wroot: You saved me. Now you'll extort me. That's how this works, yes? || [context] NodeContext: impatient
Player: You owe me nothing. || [approval] ['Astarion -1', 'Gale 1', 'Wyll 1', 'Karlach 1']
Barcus Wroot: Nothing?
Player: I'd rather know how you got caught.
Barcus Wroot: My own fault, really. I should have dropped my pack and outrun those bastards. Alas.
Barcus Wroot: Take my pack if you can find it. The only reason those goblins caught me was its weight. I'll travel lightly from now on. || [context] InternalNodeContext: Has not offered pack yet.
Player: You're a little far from home for a deep gnome.
Barcus Wroot: Ignorance is alive and well, it seems! Deep gnomes aren't restricted to the Underdark, you know - I've lived in Baldur's Gate for years. || [context] NodeContext: Testily
Barcus Wroot: I'm in search of a friend. I fear he's in trouble. He had this locket, see, that I gave him years ago before leaving home. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: He talks about the locket but doesn't have it on him to show the player
Barcus Wroot: I found it around the neck of a thug in Baldur's Gate. It was speckled with blood, my friend nowhere to be found. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: He talks about the locket but doesn't have it on him to show the player
Barcus Wroot: But I still have hope. I have reason to believe he's in the Underdark. Hopefully I'll pick up his trail from there. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: He talks about the locket but doesn't have it on him to show the player
Barcus Wroot: I always help my friends. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Looks player up and down judgementally, player should wonder 'is he talking about me?'InternalNodeContext: He hasn't given player the pack yet.
Barcus Wroot: On that note, I bid thee farewell. If we should meet again... well, we will have met again. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: He says his goodbyes, turns and walks away

----- Session: AD -----
Synopsis: If the player gets the windmill to stop spinning, then clicks Barcus, Barcus will get these lines. Barcus will be impatient, mistrustful of the player, but still in need of player's help.

Barcus Wroot: I'm going to hurl.

----- Session: TiedUp -----
Synopsis: The player has stopped the windmill from rotating and can now cut Barcus Wroot, the captive gnome, free from its sails. They can do this immediately, or else demand payment first, much to the gnome's frustration.

Barcus Wroot: Come on! What are you waiting for?! || [context] NodeContext: The gnome grows exasperated and panicky over the player's delay in cutting him free.
Barcus Wroot: Cut me loose! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The gnome is tied to the (stationary) sail of a wind, begging to be cut free by the player. He's close to the ground and within normal speaking range.NodeContext: Urgent, panicked. The gnome begs to be untied from the sail of a windmill. The sail is at the lowermost part of its rotation in relation to the ground, and the gnome is within normal speaking range.
Player: What's in it for me? || [context] NodeContext: Incredulous. His good samaritan seems to be haggling for a reward before even freeing him.
Barcus Wroot: Free me and find out. || [context] NodeContext: Impatient. He's used to being extorted.
Player: Free him.

----- Session: AD_UnfortunateGnomeFreed -----
Synopsis: After being let off the pane of the windmill.

Barcus Wroot: It's about time!

======== Scenario: for_schoologre1 ========
Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Loomp is the smart ogre. he checks for your mark since he is working for the goblin boss. You can convince him (and his fellow ogres, if they are there) to join you in battle. He should sound intelligent and HUNGRY.

Lump the Enlightened: Mm, mm, mm. Fortune favours my belly, for there is no meat more succulent than a stranger's.
Lump the Enlightened: Stranger: be you friend or food? The mark is Her measure: show us the brand of the Absolute.
Player: I'll do you one better - I'm one of her chosen disciples.
: True
Lump the Enlightened: Indeed? How regrettable, that your meat must go unsavoured.
Lump the Enlightened: Now speak or go, before my cravings conquer me. || [context] NodeContext: Should suddenly sound all ogre-ish and stupid. He's talking to his stupid brothers.
Player: Attack.
Lump the Enlightened: Dinnertime!

======== Scenario: for_courier ========
Session Sequence: Dog
----- Session: Dog -----
Synopsis: In SwA, Scratch speaks like a human. He doesn't have any kind of dog-like affectation, nor is he stupid - he's well-spoken, even when he's saying 'dog' things. Throughout the dialogue, he's stoic but heartbroken, deluding himself into believing that his master is not dead.We come across the corpse of a man being protected by his loyal dog, Scratch.The dog refuses to let us near the dead man or his belongings, forcing us to try and win him over (or else just kill him). We can use Speak with Animals to get further insight into the dog's perspective.
 If we cast Speak with Dead upon the courier, we can learn the dog's name and use this as an additional way to win it over.

Scratch: *Arf! Arf! Grrrrrarf!* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Cinematic/performance context - the dog barks with extreme agitation towards your presenceNodeContext: Cinematic/performance context - the dog barks with extreme agitation towards your presence
Player: Shoo him away.
Scratch: *Grrrr-arf! Arf! Arf!*<br> || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Cinematic/performance context - the dog grows more aggressive
Player: Peer at his collar.
: True
Narrator: *You see a name etched into the leather - 'Scratch'.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Closer look at the dog's neck (collar/tag doesn't necessarily have to be legible when combined with the narration)

======== Scenario: for_schoologres ========
Session Sequence: AD -> AfterSummon
----- Session: AD -----
Synopsis: Three ogres have a meal time discussion. Chock and Fank are stupid. Lump is smart.

Fank: Gnome taste good. Like bear.
Chock: Dwarf better. Dwarf sweet like honey.
Lump the Enlightened: Must you? This inane chatter pains me.
Chock: Hm?
Fank: Hm?
Lump the Enlightened: Oh, for... shut mouth! Head hurt! || [context] NodeContext: He is exasperated. Then he speaks in typical ogre speak.

----- Session: AfterSummon -----
Synopsis: You have agreed to summon ogres up to three times for the to help you in battle. These are the leader's conversation with you each time. THis is... complicated because there could be many deals in play.

Lump the Enlightened: No more than a few pecks? I'm afraid this spread is most inadequate. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Oger survays the battlefild.
Lump the Enlightened: Our bargain is at an end - unless, perhaps, you've a spicier deal? || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Rubbing for finger and thumb together illuding to the oger wanting gold.NodeContext: *Dupe* [Lump The Enlightened]  Rubbing for finger and thumb together illuding to the oger wanting gold. <JACK OF>
Player: Our deal is done. I wish you well.

======== Scenario: for_owlbear ========
Session Sequence: LastCub ->  -> PAD_KilledByGoblins -> VB_EggPickedUp -> VB_CubResolution_2P -> CMB_Enrage -> VB_LastCub
----- Session: LastCub -----
Synopsis: In SwA, this cub speaks in short bursts - he sounds staccato, vicious.The player has killed an owlbear - a large, predatory wild animal. The owlbear's cub remains however, and lingers by his dead mother. The player can decide whether to put the cub out of its misery, or else leave it. If the player has the speak with animals skill, they get some additional insight into the cub's anxiety. If the player lets the cub live, it will proceed to eat its mother - it's still a wild animal, after all.

Narrator: *The cub looks from you to his dead mother.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The cub looks from dead mother to the player, wailing.NodeContext: Narrator node!
Owlbear Cub: *Braawww!*

----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: In SwA, the owlbear speaks like a human. Her voice is deep and threatening - the voice of a seasoned fighter, at home in a fight and used to winning. However, she knows she's injured and at a disadvantage, but refuses to betray that to the player. Doing so might encourage the player to attack, putting her cub in danger.The player stumbles upon the nest of an owlbear; a large, predatory hybrid creature. They find themselves in a stand-off against the beast - if they get too close or act aggressively, it attacks. If they keep cool and back off when the opportunity presents itself, the owlbear will let them leave. The player may also notice that the owlbear is wounded - a broken spear protrudes from one eye socket. They may notice that the owlbear has a cub - this is the main reason for her aggression and territoriality.Additional note 1: the player may stumble upon this scenario by themselves, or they may have been pointed in the right direction after meeting some cultists who had a close encounter with the owlbear. If we won these cultists over, they may be available to fight the owlbear at our side.Additional note 2: If the owlbear mother is killed but her cub survives, we can decide the juvenile's fate. If we spare it, we may later find it being used for sport by the goblins in their camp.

Owlbear: What's this? Something weak, something tender... || [context] NodeContext: Sizing up the player.

The party can try to intervene and save the gnome, possibly using a cult symbol of authority as a way to convince the goblins, if they have it. FOR_GnomeGoblin_1 (Fezzerk) is the leader of the goblins and does most of the talking. If the player is a drow, the goblins will be much more nervous and easier to intimidate. At times, the captive goblin pipes up from the windmill, loudly pleading or berating his captors.

Fezzerk: Look what we got here - another little birdie wantin' to fly! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Cinematic/look-at context - Fezzerk notices us and calls out to his cronies. (The line is addressed to the goblin raider and scavenger, but Fezzerk's attention is broadly held by the player.NodeContext: Cruel bravado.The goblin sees the player approach and boldly announces it to his cronies - he thinks some fresh victims have just turned up.

Turning his attention to the player to deliver a threat.
Player: I'm not looking for trouble - just want to pass by.
Fezzerk: Heh, funny. That's what our birdie wanted. || [context] NodeContext: Mocking. Refers to the player's previous statement ('I don't want trouble - just want to pass by').
Barcus Wroot: ...Release me this instant, you beasts! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Context - the deep gnome yells at his captors as he swings into earshotNodeContext: Panicked, angry. Issuing an ultimatum even though he has no means of following through on it.
Fezzerk: 'Less you wanna join him up there, you'd best pay the toll. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The lead goblin looks at his hands and tries to calculate a figure with his fingers.NodeContext: Fezzerk mockingly refers to the deep gnome's predicament as he threatens the player. 'Passing by' refers to rotating on a windmill rather than safe passage through the area, in his book.
Fezzerk: Cough it up! ([GEN_CheckMagicPocketGold_6057ad05-9492-4630-9f0a-be548b134c54]) || [context] InternalNodeContext: The idea is the goblin is a bit dim greedy and throwing out a stupidly high number.NodeContext: Fezzerk declares his price.

Brawler Rancer: Tha's the that of it. Heh! || [context] NodeContext: verydrunk

======== Scenario: gob_innercheckpoint ========
Session Sequence: Backup_01 -> 3way_UpsetAndCapturedGoblins
----- Session: Backup_01 -----
Synopsis: This guard is lowly backup, but eager to lord a position of authority over anyone they can.

Tracker Fezk: 'S good you ain't causin' trouble. Boss means business, now he's got the Absolute in his ear. || [context] NodeContext: Tone of false threat - they've been handed a position of meagre authority and are trying to lord it over you.

----- Session: 3way_UpsetAndCapturedGoblins -----
Synopsis: A three-way checkpoint dialog if Sazza (Captured Goblin) was freed in the Den. The guard would usually stop us but instead gives player free access to the Goblin Throne region.

Warrior Trinzas: Oi! Ain't no party in 'ere - || [context] NodeContext: Sudden, barked - she's on guard duty and takes it very seriously, assumes you're a drunkard coming in from the party outside.
Sazza: Shut it, Graw. Olak cleared us - got a visitor for the drow, I do. || [context] NodeContext: As if at a yapping dog. Sazza and Graw have bad blood, and Sazza loves being in a position of authority above her.
Warrior Trinzas: My arse - what's a True Soul want with any mate o' yours? || [context] NodeContext: Disbelieving - to Graw, Sazza is the lowest of the low but has always had high opinion of herself.
Sazza: Private business, that is. Raidin' business. But if anyone wants a pisspot guarded, we'll call. || [context] NodeContext: Putting on airs - Sazza has been chosen to go out on raids, Graw hasn't, and Sazza's rubbing it in.
Warrior Trinzas: Just get your friend branded proper, right Sazza? Got better things to do th- || [context] NodeContext: Disgusted, dismissive. Trying to have the last word and claim a scrap of authority by telling Sazza to the player marked so she doesn't have to stop us again. Cut off at the end by Sazza's reply
Sazza: No you don't. Come on, then. || [context] NodeContext: Dismissive, bored, matter-of-fact. Snubbing Graw and sweeping past, addressing us to follow with the second line.

======== Scenario: gob_voloballad ========
Session Sequence: Volo_Massacre -> Guard_AtCage
----- Session: Volo_Massacre -----
Synopsis: Volo, a reknowned scholar, has been captured by goblins and is being forced to sing on a stage at their celebratory party following a raid. One goblin has the responsibility of guarding him and engages him in conversation. If the goblins are killed, he investigates the corpses, researching the cause of death.

Volo: There! That's the last frothing innard catalogued. || [context] NodeContext: investigating dead goblins - pleased to meet the perpetraror of the masscare
Volo: Best not to hang around. Whoever is responsible for this mess may still be here... unless this was your doing? || [context] NodeContext: polite advice on first sentence, and then a warning. The final phrase is a mixture of curiosity and awe
Player: Guilty. I killed them all.
Volo: You? Why? And how? But wait, wait - let me get a fresh quill. Now. You were saying? || [context] NodeContext: preparing to take notes like an inquisitive journalist at a crime scene
Player: Never mind. What are you doing here anyway - looting corpses?
Volo: Just nosing out the facts. Something happened here, and it's my job - my calling - to discover what. || [context] NodeContext: arrogant - his 'calling' (at this moment, asking annoying questions) is the most important thing in the world as far as he sees it
Volo: But if you won't tell me, no matter. A truth is second best to the truth. || [context] NodeContext: journalistic type who is more interested in a good story than a true story
Volo: Hmmm... Your story may be relevant, but the stench of this place is hardly suited to civilised conversation. || [context] NodeContext: politely trying to tag along with the players
Volo: I wonder if we might continue this elsewhere. You've a brain I'd like to pick.
Player: Pick a different brain. I can't help you.
Volo: I'll be no trouble, my friend. Name a location and I'd be happy to meet you there. || [context] NodeContext: a polite plea
Player: Leave.

----- Session: Guard_AtCage -----
Synopsis: Drunk, excited goblin who's guarding Volo and forcing him to sing even though Volo's no singer.

Gribbo: Don't go botherin' my pigeon! He's mine. || [context] NodeContext: annoyed, defensive - the 'pigeon' is in fact Volo, a human captive she's been forcing to sing; he's now locked behind a prison door
Player: So I see. Do you have plans for this 'pigeon'?
Gribbo: Keep him safe. Listen to him coo. 'Til I gets hungry or some such. || [context] NodeContext: explaining as if to an idiot
Gribbo: What's it to ya? || [context] NodeContext: accusatory
Player: Leave.

Synopsis: After Goblin Hunt Celebration night and persuading Minthara to spare their lives, player can observe Goblin camp being empty with only one goblin trader looting what's rest in the Festivities area.This is that goblin's dialog.

Glomp the looter: How you doing, pal? Looking for some odds and ends? I've scavenged all sorts. || [context] NodeContext: friendly, like a cheeky bloke at a market selling stolen goods
Glomp the looter: Didn't expect to see you grubbing around here in the muck and the leftovers. || [context] NodeContext: friendly
Player: Where are the rest of the goblins?
Glomp the looter: On their way to Moonrise, with her ladyship. They left me here to make sure we ain't left nothing valuable behind. || [context] NodeContext: friendly

======== Scenario: gob_halsin ========
Session Sequence: PAD_EnteringGoblinCamp
----- Session: PAD_EnteringGoblinCamp -----
Synopsis: Thematically, this VB is a conversation about the goblin camp and how difficult it might be to find the druid there. Player will be aware that he's being held captive somewhere in the camp and can see the goblins's strength.This occurs over walking into a trigger, so lines between speaker 1 and speaker 2 can be fairly opinionated.

Player: The druid Halsin is in here somewhere.
Player: Let's hope we find him in one piece.

Mayrina: No! No, I don't know them. || [context] NodeContext: Panic. You don't want to get in trouble
: Come now - aren't you going to introduce yourself? || [context] NodeContext: Slight smile as your turn your sights on the player. You're more cheerful now.
Player: Usually people ask what, as opposed to who, I am.
: That's because most people are afraid of their own bloody shadows. Not me, though. Auntie Ethel welcomes everyone.

Should we side with the brothers, Ethel is angry and disappears with a threat.

: Lads, for the love of all that is holy, I've never clapped eyes on your poor sister. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Looking at the brothers - hasn't noticed the player yet. NodeContext: Opening line of the dialogue. Annoyed as you plead with the two men who advance on you. You sound sincere and genuine.
Johl: Drop the act, hag. You was the last to see Mayrina. || [context] NodeContext: Not buying Auntie Ethel's claim that she hasn't seen Mayrina. Accusation and fury in your voice - you're prepared to get violent if needs be.
Demir: Just let her go. Please. || [context] NodeContext: Your brother is on the brink of violence and you're trying to regain control of the situation. You just want your baby sister back, you don't want anyone to get hurt.
: You there! Please, I don't know what's come over these boys. I just want to go home. || [context] NodeContext: You've caught sight of the player. You call out, fear and pleading in your voice - in your mind you've hatched a plan - you're going to force the player to defend you and kill the brothers.

Finally, if the player finds his wife's body, he is heartbroken - he believes her death is his fault, because of a silly argument that they had.

Once outside, Benryn is in shock at the carnage around him - bodies of goblins and humans litter the inn's courtyard. He snaps out of his shock when he thinks of his wife, who was outside when the raiding party arrived. He pleads for the player to help him find her - when players do, she is already dead. Pointed to her body, Benryn breaks down - the weight of guilt immediately crushing him.The barbarian class will have advantage in a strength check to lift the wreckage off Benryn, however if they fail, they can try again with a higher DC.
