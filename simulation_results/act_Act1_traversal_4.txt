----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Adventurer leader dialogue. Mostly used during Adventurers Quest. This is after the player has stopped Zevlor and Aradin from fighting one another. Aradin returns to his den to lick his wounds.

Aradin: If it ain't the friendly drow. Thought you were with the goblins when you showed up at the gate.
Aradin: Glad you weren't - you fight well. Not like them bloody tieflings.
Player: You fought well, too.
Aradin: Half my crew are full of holes. || [context] NodeContext: annoyed, slightly sad
Aradin: Now I'm gonna take the blame for leading the goblins here, and losing track of the bloody druid. || [context] NodeContext: He knows these things are his fault, but he's sulking and petulant about it
Player: Where did the goblins come from?
Aradin: They chased us all the way from the ruins we were poking around in.
Player: And is that where you lost track of the druid you mentioned?
Aradin: Aye. His name's Halsin, and if he's still alive, he'll be cursing the day he laid eyes on me.
Aradin: We've got a contract to track down some relic, and he wanted in on the job. Eyes lit up when he heard about it.
Aradin: Didn't work out, though. Goblins got him when we were turning tail. He's either diggin' latrines or boilin' in a cookpot by now.
Player: Can I have a look at that contract?
Aradin: Job's all yours, if you got a death wish. || [context] NodeContext: 'You can have it, buddy'
Aradin: There's a wizard in Baldur's Gate that'll pay gobloads for a relic, supposedly buried round these parts.
Aradin: But gold ain't any use if you're too cold to spend it. || [context] NodeContext: Flippant
Player: Any idea what the relic actually is?
Aradin: If I knew that, I wouldn't be back here with half my crew gone. || [context] NodeContext: Bitter and sarcastic

Aradin: It's called the Nightsong. Supposed to be hidden under the temple where the goblins jumped us.

Player: What about the people here?
Arron: We druids will be safe. As for those that took refuge here... well, may Silvanus guard them as they continue their travels.
Player: Seems like most are tieflings. They'll be fine. They have devilish powers. || [approval] ['Astarion 1', 'Wyll -1', 'Karlach -1']

He is exasperated, furious, but also eager to meet anyone who could help. In the same dialogue, we can also uncover that he is in fact a traitor, concerned only with getting these people through the goblins so he can trade them for his own safety later.

======== Scenario: den_volotravel ========
Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Volo is a canonical character in DnD. He's known for being the realm's go-to guy for compiling information. In this take, he fulfils that role but puts a twist on what he sees. He's keenly curious for facts but likes to embellish them. A bit like Gilderoy Lockheart. He IS talented, but his reputation has gotten away from him, too. In this dialogue, Volo will offer to put his knowledge at your service if you confide you've been infected with a mindflayer. He'll perform an icepick lobotomy that'll leave you without an eye or much in the way of apology from Volo. He should be clever, a little arrogant, very English, and very fun, without being a cartoon character.

Volo: Pardon me! Must prepare to travel - good day, my friend! || [context] NodeContext: Cheerfully done with you.
Player: Where are you heading?
Volo: ...I'll tell you, if you'd be so good as to answer a few questions pertaining to the goblins you encountered at the gates. || [context] NodeContext: Trying to entice the player.
Volo: A few questions, if you please. There's no overstating my interest. || [context] NodeContext: He wants to write down what you'll say. Enthusiastic.
Player: Fine - ask your questions.
Volo: Glory! Now, then: || [context] CinematicNodeContext: He's ready to write, quill to book.NodeContext: Player agreed to answer his questions. He's happy but also arrogant, like a rich old person saying 'you're an absolute DOLL' when you do a minor favor for them.
Volo: How would you describe that particular batch of goblins? Size? Nature? Distinguishing qualities? || [context] NodeContext: Quizzing the player, looking for info for his book. He's more professional here, curious.
: True
Narrator: *You search your mind, successfully recalling various details of goblin behaviour.*
Player: Common variety goblins, led by a lasher and flanked by booyahgs.
Volo: My! A scholar after my own heart. Spent much time among goblins?
Player: The time was spent among books. I'm a student of the page. || [approval] ['Gale 1']
Volo: Aha! I've always preferred experience to the second-hand accounts of lesser men. But to each their own!
Volo: Now I've a few more questions, if you don't mind.
Volo: And the... dragon they had marching in the rear. Was it of the brass or silver variety? || [context] NodeContext: Volo is bullshitting. There was no dragon and he knows it. But he's stating it to the player as though he believes it.
Player: I think there's been a misunderstanding. What do you want, exactly?
Volo: The truth, my friend! Not a jot more or less! || [context] NodeContext: Response to 'What are you getting at.' Volo doesn't really want the truth but he believes in his own morality.
Volo: Last question, then you'll be quite free. Did the attackers rally to 'the Absolute' when they fell upon the gates? || [context] NodeContext: He's wrapping things up, in full journalism mode.
Player: I don't think so. I was concentrating on not dying.
Volo: Really? Well, this does complicate things... but then again... well, never mind. || [context] NodeContext: Player says goblins didn't invoke 'the Absolute.' Volo is turning the idea around in his head, trying to figure it out. A man in thought.
Volo: I've interrogated one - a captive in this very camp. She reports they've abandoned their god Maglubiyet in favour of someone called 'the Absolute'.
Volo: The scandal! || [context] NodeContext: Hissed like he's just conveyed a very juicy bit of gossip
Player: What do you think Maglubiyet makes of this change?
Volo: Oh, I'd imagine him quite displeased. || [context] NodeContext: Like he's conveying a bit of juicy gossip.
Volo: Since their change in allegiance, these goblins are informed by a kind of strategy anathema to their kind. || [context] NodeContext: He finds this VERY interesting.

It's me or a goblin cookpot - I know which I'd choose. || [context] NodeContext: Scornful but not overly so - she's more bored of your moralising than anything. Ilmater (ihl-MAY-ter) is a god of compassion and martyrdom. She has no time for your bleeding heart - she's all pragmatism.
Roah Moonglow: Now - much obliged for the chat, but I'm here to trade. || [context] NodeContext: Insincere about the chat - she's just Impatient to get back to the matter at hand.
Player: Leave.

Sentinel Olak: Not to worry! I'll set 'em straight. Bit of music never hurt anyone, eh? || [context] NodeContext: Bright, cheerful, reassuring you

----- Session: Guard005 -----

Synopsis: One of the three goblins that are serve as a backup for the checkpoint in case of emergency. Telling a story of the inn ransacking. Really into violence :)

Player: Sounds like a bloody scrap. Where did you see that?
Devout Wasp: You ain't hear? We sacked Waukeen's Rest and left it to burn.

Devout Wasp: Glorious.

Sharp-Eye Snurd: Oi! Get down from there!
Player: Whatever you say.

----- Session: Backup001 -----
Synopsis: One of the three goblins that are serve as a backup for the checkpoint in case of emergency. This goblin is a bit touched in the head and wonders whether you're a member of her tribe. She's a woman even though some of the notes are male.

Narrator: *A strange symbol glows, marked on their flesh, and something within you stirs in response.*

----- Session: Guard001 -----
Synopsis: All guards at the checkpoint point the player to the guard with this dialog. He is an evil, nasty character who has no reason to go easy on the player. Should ooze disdain. This is the first goblin we meet and their weasly, cruel, wicked nature should stand out.
The goblin will let a non-allied player in only if they smear worg shit on their face. Yuck.

Sentinel Olak: Lookit, Klaw! Supper's here! || [context] InternalNodeContext: haven't met the guards yet, not drowNodeContext: Goblin's talking to his worg (big gross wolf). Evil character, not a nice person.
Sentinel Olak: Unless you got another reason to be here, feck-shite. || [context] NodeContext: Addressed to player. Dripping with disdain.

Player: Beautiful animal. Does she belong to the Nordiland worgata family?
: True
Sentinel Olak: How'd you know? || [context] NodeContext: He's impressed. He's a worg expert so your knowledge appeals to him, but he doesn't want to make it too easy for you.
Sentinel Olak: Dumb as a rock, but world class at tearin' the throats outta wee ones, she is. || [context] NodeContext: Bit of affection, he's talking about his dog. Still with a hint of malice, though.
Sentinel Olak: Rest of her litter's inside, in the pens. Beautiful beasts. || [context] NodeContext: Bit of affection, he's talking about his dog. Still with a hint of malice, though.
Player: I've never seen a pack up close - always wanted to.
Sentinel Olak: Be a shame if you came all this way without havin' a look. But I can't let you pass just like that.
Sentinel Olak: Celebratin' a raid, we are. You'll need to wear our war colours. || [context] NodeContext: Said greasily. He's playing a trick on the player.
Sentinel Olak: Nice dab o' this across the mug oughta do it. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: *He pointed to a steaming pile of worg dung at his feet.*NodeContext: Pointing to worg shit as he says this. Stifling an evil laugh. He's told the player to smear shit in their face.
Player: Scoop up the warm dung and fling it at Olak's face. || [approval] ['Astarion 1', "Lae'zel 1", 'Wyll 1', 'Karlach 5']
: True
Sentinel Olak: MY EYES! YOU SHITEY FECK-SHITE! || [context] InternalNodeContext: Can flinging dung at Olek make him go blind for combat?NodeContext: Player threw dung in Olak's eyes. This leads to combat.

Player: It can look all it likes. I've got nothing to hide.
Skrut: If that's how you get yer kicks, ain't no business o' mine. || [context] NodeContext: Player has said they don'tt mind the device watching them. Goblin has interpreted it as having no issue with being watched in the latrine.
Skrut: But when yer takin' a tinkle, be sure to wave, eh? The bigwigs at Moonrise love a good show. || [context] NodeContext: Almost a sly wink at wave. He's joking -  Knows those in Moonrise would be furious.

----- Session: DwarvenAlchemist -----
Synopsis: Derryth is a dwarven alchemist visiting the underdark from Baldur's Gate. She runs a shop in the city with Baelen, her business partner. They've come to the underdark in search of a very valuable mushroom - noblestalk. When the player arrived, she was tending to an injured gnome.
Derryth is a bit gruff - she's a healer, but her bedside manner leaves a lot to be desired. She's also a very shrewd businessperson. She's in the underdark to get rich first and foremost.
She treats her business partner (Baelen) like he's an idiot, and pretends not to care about him, but in reality he is the most important person to her in the world.

Derryth Bonecloak: Just leave me, I said. You've done enough damage already.
Derryth Bonecloak: You don't know what you've done. Leave me be. || [context] NodeContext: Player cured Baelen. She's facing a terrible future.
Player: I know exactly what I've done. Very entertaining. || [approval] ['Wyll -1', 'Karlach -1']
Derryth Bonecloak: You're a beast - you and Baelen  would make fine bedfellows.
Derryth Bonecloak: Get out of my face. Find some else's suffering to lap up.

Restless Myconid: ((*the disease still festers. I will cut it out*))

Narrator: *The creature's song rumbles within you, neither warm nor welcoming.*

----- Session: VB_GlutDead_1P -----
Synopsis: Players refuse to kill Sovereign Spawn on Sovereign Glut's behalf. Glut has attacked the players and is now dead. The party comments afterwards.

Player: The usurper is dead. So much for 'Circle Glut'.

----- Session: CheckpointGuard_000 -----
Synopsis: You come upon the myconid guards. They warn the sovereign of your presence telepathically, and it begins to speak to you. This should be creepy, hallucinatory.

Narrator: *You are swallowed by a chorus of turbulent music. Through one creature sing many voices: the harmony of an entire collective.*
Restless Myconid: ((*Sovereign. they have come. they are here*))
Narrator: *The choir fades. A single melody rises above the others, brassy and commanding.*
: ((*I am Sovereign*))
Narrator: *You see a vision: your lifeless body, wrapped in fungal tendrils. The sovereign is threatening you.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Player closes eyes as if seeing the vision in their head.
: ((*state your purpose*))
Player: I am a traveller seeking adventure. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Player closes eyes.

Narrator: *The persistent music coaxes you forward. The sovereign expects you.*

----- Session: DeepRothe -----
Synopsis: A Deep Rothe that belongs to Derryth and Baelen Bonecloak. A beast of burden with a simple Speak with Animals dialogue. There's some reactivity depending on whether Baelen has returned to the bonecloak camp or not, and if Baelen recovered his senses by eating the noblestalk mushroom. The animal's observations reinforce that Baelen has been more amiable and gentle since his mind began to slip, and his recovery is not seen as a good thing by all.

Deep Rothé: Master sounds different, like old self. Angry self. Don't like. || [context] NodeContext: SWA line. Reproachful. A simple beast of burden senses his master has returned to a crueler demeanour.

Synopsis: A sovereign myconid we call the brooding sovereign has been displaced to this myconid circle, after the duergar attackes his home. He would like to join you as you cleanse the area of duergar as a means of getting revenge - supposedly.

 The top block: The borroding myconid is with the other myconids. You can recruit it.

The middle block: You have killed the lone duergar. the myconid now wants you to kill all the duergars.

 Next block: you have killed all the duergars; now it wants you to kill the sovereign
. 
Final block: you have killed the sovereign and it rewards you. 

This myconid does not speak with the same hive mind voice of the others. He should sound creepy, like FART in Rick and Morty, with a SLIGHT undercurrent of menace.

 As the quest moves on, he gets more and more creepy and angry,

Sovereign Glut: ((*the tumour is excised. the duergar are dead*))
Sovereign Glut: ((*here, I break ground. from the dark will a mighty Circle rise. my song will fill the Grotto!*))
Sovereign Glut: ((*death-doer - the Grotto may sustain but one Sovereign. in the Age of Glut...*))
Sovereign Glut: ((*...there may be no Spaw. eliminate the other Sovereign*))
Player: Why not. Spaw's time is done. || [approval] ['Astarion 1', 'Wyll -1']

Sovereign Glut: ((*the Age of Glut begins*))

Noxious Myconid: ((*no peace*))

----- Session: ServantDuergar1 -----
Synopsis: Player tries speaking with an enthralled duergar. Duergar players get an option to go hostile afterwards.

Narrator: *Fungus and mould glaze the servant's face and body. Through music and vision, the sovereign reveals its origins.*
Narrator: *You see a frothing duergar, axe drawn, crazed by bloodlust, bearing down on a young myconid.*
Narrator: *The frightened myconid circle conjures mildewed vines. They encircle and transform the duergar.*

----- Session: DeadMyconid_Dead -----
Synopsis: Speak with dead on Myconid sprout. Sprouts are children. This one should sound young. It describes being killed by grey dwarves (duergar). Should not sound like hivemind.

Narrator: *The corpse twitches in response to the spell...*
: False
Narrator: *...and awaits your first question.*
Player: What was your role in the circle?
Narrator: *Like its living counterparts, the corpse speaks in your mind.*
Dead Myconid Sprout: ((*...to grow. to know. to be one with the Circle...*))

----- Session: InjuredGnome -----
Synopsis: STATE NODES - first half of dialogue, Thulla is in EXTREME pain, speaking in short, terse sentences.Second half - she's weary but recovering.Thulla is a member of the Ironhand Gnomes, a group of militant gnomish artificers who came to the Underdark to find a forbidden - and extremely secret - formula for runepowder: an explosive of awesome power.Thulla is a true believer in the cause - when her group was captured by duergar, she escaped but picked up a poisoned wound on the way. She's slowly succumbing to poison - initially vague and feverish. If we heal her, she's exhausted but straight back on task, giving us the job of freeing her people.

Thulla: No need for me to ask how you fared - some of my kin have already made it here, safe and sound. || [context] NodeContext: A little more relaxed than we've seen her - eyeing us up and impressed with what she sees
Thulla: It's past time we were back in the city. But if you find yourself there, call on us. The Ironhand Gnomes are good friends to have. || [context] InternalNodeContext: Reputation +1NodeContext: Impressed and grateful. On the mend
Player: What will you do when you return?
Thulla: Like I say, we Ironhands make good friends. || [context] NodeContext: Shrug
Thulla: But bad enemies, too. Some folk are about to be reminded of that. || [context] NodeContext: Fierce, ominous

----- Session: SocietyOfBrilliance_MindFlayer -----
Synopsis: Omeluum is a friendly, neutral mind flayer and member of the Society of Brilliance, dedicated to improving life in the Underdark. If attacked, it will teleport away rather than engaging in combat.

Omeluum: You return. Have you changed your mind about the ring?
Omeluum: I greet you, sun child.
Player: How do you survive? Don't you need... brains?
Omeluum: In the beginning, I had an arrangement with a lich. Excellent company, despite what one would expect.
Omeluum: I required brains, he required souls. A perfect symbiosis.
Omeluum: But our ambitions eventually splintered. I wished to better the world, and he preferred its rot.
Omeluum: So I left his company, and thus I now feed from those who... act against the Society's goals.
Player: That's disgusting. You're a monster.
Omeluum: I cannot change my appetites. Although I am experimenting in reducing them with magic.
Omeluum: Perhaps with time, it can be one brain a year instead of one a month...
Omeluum: I greet you, sun child.
Player: I'd like to learn more about the tadpole.<br> || [approval] ['Karlach 1']
Narrator: *An almost childlike joy enters Omeluum's ichor-laced eyes.*
Omeluum: Open your mind to me, friend. Let us see what lurks within.

Omeluum: I see. I will remain here if you decide otherwise.

Corsair Greymon: Godsdamned dwarf. What are you doing on Gekh's raft?
Corsair Greymon: Where's Gekh? Who are you?
Player: Duergar, like you? Saw his body a way back. Myconids got him.

Synopsis: Player discovers an improvised shrine to a dead drow warrior. There's a helmet resting on a sword that's been rammed into a stone. You can take the helmet, but you'll need to think of another way to get the sword free.

Narrator: *A slender drow blade impales the stone before you, keeping a silent vigil.*
Narrator: *You recognise your goddess' rite - a warrior's sacrifice. Only blood, freely given, will honour the fallen.*

----- Session: PAD_RecogniseStashLocation -----
Synopsis: The party has read a Harper's letter and has arrived where they expect their stash to be.

Player: Looks like the place the Dark Justiciar's letter mentioned. But where's the stash?

----- Session: PAD_RecogniseWatchword -----
Synopsis: The Sharran Inquisitor's diary documents the Harper Spy's interrogation. The spy is quoted reciting a Harper Watchword during the interrogation. Players that pass a History Check will recognise the watchword, and understand that the Light spell is required to bypass the spy's trap

Player: What was that watchword? 'Lux splenda.'
Player: But what does it mean?

----- Session: PAD_KnowStashIsHidden -----
Synopsis: Note: this PAD follows directly from either RecogniseStashLocation or FoundRune. See Kevin V. with any questions, I know it is a bit weird.--------When the player recognises that the Harper rune in Ketheric City is marking a hidden stash, they make an Investigation check. On success, they realise that the Harpers would be smart enough not to leave their stash in plain sight - the goal of this hint is to deter the player from interacting with the mimics in the area and to instead look around for a hidden stash somewhere

Player: Must be in one of these chests.

Narrator: *As you near the rubble, a fragmented voice clutches at your mind.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Nere starting to Mindmeld with the player
Nere: A Tru... Sou... True Soul? || [context] NodeContext: The original line is 'A True Soul? This is Nere. Tell those Imbiciles to hurry up! I am choking on poison.' Should be recorded normally, and effects should be added later to make it sound like the voice is fading in and out.
Nere: Finally! You must clear... rubble. Filling... poison!
Player: Stay still. I'll do what I can.
Nere: ...it quick or... head! Careful... mercs... on the edge...
Nere: ...Get me OUT!

Player: Try to focus. What more can you see?

Narrator: *The harder you look, the fuzzier the images become, until there is only grey.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Image blurs before greying out/fading to black

----- Session: Mutiny -----
Synopsis: Dialogue after you destroy the cave-in and set Nere free. Thrinn has been put in charge of getting Nere out, but it's the player who accomplishes it. Nere almost just died from inhaling poisonous gas, so he's very angry. In this dialogue, you determine the fate of the gnomes as well as Nere and the mutinous duergar.

Nere: Finally. || [context] NodeContext: Said with great relief, but tinged with anger
Nere: Worthless slaves. Your incompetence has been my ruin. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Addressed to the gnomesNodeContext: Intense but quietly so.

Nere: You care for the weak, True Soul. Most curious. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: To playerNodeContext: Quiet.
Player: This isn't about them. I just can't stand your face.
Nere: And yet you came to my aid.
Nere: A test - yes, you must be. The Absolute bade you to try Nere's faith.
Nere: Thrinn. Carve out their heart and serve it to the rothé. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Addressed to sergeant Thrinn.
Nere: If they are indeed a True Soul, let the Absolute save them. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Addressed to Thrinn
Player: You wouldn't dare. I'm faithful to the Absolute.

He's been captured once again - this time by a band of duergar (who follow the Absolute, same as the goblins did previously). If you get rid of his captors, you can talk to him some more about his next steps. He's still keen on saving his friend, Wulbren.

Barcus Wroot: Well. You... did it!
Barcus Wroot: I shouldn't be surprised, considering our history. And yet...
Player: You're free - go on.
Barcus Wroot: Free. Yes. || [context] NodeContext: Wavering.
Barcus Wroot: Nothing good happens in the Underdark.
Barcus Wroot: I don't know if you heard, but some of the Ironhand Gnomes - my friend Wulbren among them - have been taken prisoner in Moonrise Towers.
Barcus Wroot: I know someone of your background would fit right in in that heart of horrors, but for others of us it's quite a frightening prospect.
Barcus Wroot: And so... to Moonrise Towers I go. || [context] NodeContext: Resolute but actually pretty frightened.
Player: Do you know what Wulbren and the others were doing down here?
Barcus Wroot: No.
: False
Player: Farewell, Barcus - I wish you luck with your search. || [approval] ['Gale 1', 'Wyll 5', 'Karlach 5']
Barcus Wroot: Won't be needing it, thank you!

======== Scenario: und_fearfulrothe ========
Session Sequence: Rothe_002 -> Guard_001
----- Session: Rothe_002 -----
Synopsis: Panicky and bestial. A one-liner deep rothe speak with animals dialogue. It's being used by duergar to clear rocks, only it and another rothe have been unsettled by strange noises and stopped responding to their masters. It can be calmed so it can return to its work (the act of calming occurs when speaking to the othe rothe, whom this one takes its cues from).

Deep Rothé: Grey ones gone. Good. Will stay here, until it's safe to leave. || [context] NodeContext: Glad captors are gone - good riddance (the duergar could be dead or ordered to go elsewhere)
Player: How about breaking through that rubble for me?
Deep Rothé: For killing grey ones - yes. I will do this.

----- Session: Guard_001 -----
Synopsis: The taskmaster is another cruel duergar. He is whipping several pack animals to clear out some rubble, but his arm is tired and asks you to step in. You might discover they want the rubble cleared because a valuable forge can be found behind it. If you convince the beasts to break through, he attacks you because he doesn't want to share the wealth.

Herdmaster Skarjall: Well look here - Nere's killer in the flesh. Make yourself useful, grab a cane and whip these drugnin' beasts into shape. || [context] NodeContext: Hoon = outsider. Dorn = friend. Urop (YUR-op) - slave.
Herdmaster Skarjall: That rubble needs clearing, and my patience is hanging on by an arse whisker.
Herdmaster Skarjall: Shouldn't be trouble for a brute like you.
Player: Do your own dirty work.
Herdmaster Skarjall: Don't think I won't thrash you harder than the rothé. || [context] NodeContext: Cruel
Herdmaster Skarjall: Something's spooked the dumbshits. So stop your jawin', and get to workin'.

--- Scenario Details ---
======== Scenario: for_schoologre3 ========
Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: Ogre in the middle of a meal. Dumb as a box of rocks.

Chock: Friend. No eat friend.

======== Scenario: for_unfortunategnome ========
Session Sequence:  -> TiedUp -> Dead
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: The player speaks to a deep gnome after freeing him from some goblins, who'd had him tied to the sail of a windmill. The player discovers that the deep gnome travelled to the region as he learned his old friend is in danger. By way of thanks, he provides the player with the means to craft smokepowder, an explosive item. He then leaves for the Underdark in search of his friend. There, the player may encounter him again.

Barcus Wroot: Urrrgh... magga cammara - those pustulent thugs! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Cinematic/actor context - the deep gnome sways dizzilyNodeContext: 'Magga cammara' pronounced 'Mag-ah cam-ah-rah'. Gnomish exclamation meaning 'by the stones'.
Barcus the deep gnome is suffering some grogginess after spinning on the sail of a windmill for the last while.
Barcus Wroot: Well - get on with it. || [context] NodeContext: Still a little out of sorts after his ordeal spinning on a windmill, now a mixture of resigned and annoyed. He's expecting you to extort him now.
Player: Get on with what?
Barcus Wroot: I'm a deep gnome, you're a drow. You helped me, now you plan to enslave me.
Player: That's not what I want.
Barcus Wroot: What, then? Torture? Bloodsport? Or perhaps just a good old-fashioned walloping?
Player: You owe me nothing. || [approval] ['Astarion -1', 'Gale 1', 'Wyll 1', 'Karlach 1']
Barcus Wroot: Nothing?
Player: I'd rather know how you got caught.
Barcus Wroot: My own fault, really. I should have dropped my pack and outrun those bastards. Alas.
Barcus Wroot: Take my pack if you can find it. The only reason those goblins caught me was its weight. I'll travel lightly from now on. || [context] InternalNodeContext: Has not offered pack yet.
Player: Leave.

----- Session: TiedUp -----
Synopsis: The player has stopped the windmill from rotating and can now cut Barcus Wroot, the captive gnome, free from its sails. They can do this immediately, or else demand payment first, much to the gnome's frustration.

Barcus Wroot: Cut me loose! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The gnome is tied to the (stationary) sail of a wind, begging to be cut free by the player. He's close to the ground and within normal speaking range.NodeContext: Urgent, panicked. The gnome begs to be untied from the sail of a windmill. The sail is at the lowermost part of its rotation in relation to the ground, and the gnome is within normal speaking range.
Player: What's in it for me? || [context] NodeContext: Incredulous. His good samaritan seems to be haggling for a reward before even freeing him.
Barcus Wroot: Free me and find out. || [context] NodeContext: Impatient. He's used to being extorted.
Player: Free him.

----- Session: Dead -----
Synopsis: This is the gnome's spirit once he's dead. He's still focused on Wulbren, his first love, who he believes to be in danger.

Narrator: *The corpse regards you lifelessly.*
Player: Who are you?
Barcus Wroot: Barcus... he... called... me... Barcus...

======== Scenario: for_gnomegoblin4 ========
Session Sequence:  -> AD_Leaving
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: A goblin tracker stands guard as their leader torments a captive. If the player interferes, they turn hostile (unless the player is a drow - in this case the goblins are servile and afraid).

Goblin Tracker: A drow...? Erm, I mean, glory to you, True Soul. || [context] NodeContext: Grovelling

----- Session: AD_Leaving -----
Synopsis: A band of goblins elect to leave the area where they've been 'playing' with gnome prisoner after the player convinced them to clear off, one way or another. One goblin beckons to a worg - time to head off.

Goblin Tracker: C'mon, blood-breath. Let's find you something to eat. || [context] NodeContext: Speaking to a worg companion, urging it to come along.
Worg: Fresh meat... scared meat... yessss. || [context] NodeContext: Worgs are vicious beasts but have a little more sentience than most animals, and are capable of rudimentary speech.

======== Scenario: for_blueprints ========
Session Sequence: 
======== Scenario: for_gnomegoblin6 ========
Session Sequence: 
======== Scenario: for_bottomlesswell ========
Session Sequence: InteractWithWell -> VB_DiscoverUnderdarkEntrance -> AD_EttercapDisturbanceWarning
----- Session: InteractWithWell -----
Synopsis: Dialogue when first interacting with the well.

Narrator: *Apart from an overgrowth of moss, the well looks unremarkable.*
Player: Peer into the well.
: False
Narrator: *Dry stones line the wall, but the darkness below is impenetrable.*

----- Session: VB_DiscoverUnderdarkEntrance -----
Synopsis: The player finds the deep pit leading to the underdark.

Player: I feel a breeze - I wonder what's down there.
Player: Well. After you. || [context] NodeContext: This person doesn't trust it.

----- Session: AD_EttercapDisturbanceWarning -----
Synopsis: The ettercap feels that someone stepped on its web and lets out a warning screech.

: *Screech.* || [context] NodeContext: A bit like a spider chirp, but a bit louder, if possible.

======== Scenario: for_courier ========
Session Sequence: Dead -> Dog
----- Session: Dead -----
Synopsis: Using Speak with Dead, we are able to talk to the spirit of Gomwick. He was killed by a band of gnolls, but managed to save his dog, Scratch, by forcing him to flee.

Narrator: *The corpse regards you lifelessly.*
Player: Who are you?
Gomwick: ... Gomwick...

----- Session: Dog -----
Synopsis: In SwA, Scratch speaks like a human. He doesn't have any kind of dog-like affectation, nor is he stupid - he's well-spoken, even when he's saying 'dog' things. Throughout the dialogue, he's stoic but heartbroken, deluding himself into believing that his master is not dead.We come across the corpse of a man being protected by his loyal dog, Scratch.The dog refuses to let us near the dead man or his belongings, forcing us to try and win him over (or else just kill him). We can use Speak with Animals to get further insight into the dog's perspective.
 If we cast Speak with Dead upon the courier, we can learn the dog's name and use this as an additional way to win it over.

Scratch: *Arf! Arf! Grrrrrarf!* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Cinematic/performance context - the dog barks with extreme agitation towards your presenceNodeContext: Cinematic/performance context - the dog barks with extreme agitation towards your presence
Player: Shoo him away.
Scratch: *Grrrr-arf! Arf! Arf!*<br> || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Cinematic/performance context - the dog grows more aggressive
Player: Kneel - you mean no harm.
: True
Narrator: *The dog lowers his hackles, his head tilted inquisitively.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Cinematic/performance context - the dog tilts its head/shows uncertainty.
Narrator: *Convinced that you're harmless, he turns his attention back to the corpse.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The dog looks to the corpse nearby, barks. The corpse is clearly dead.
Player: Leave.

======== Scenario: for_ngb ========
Session Sequence: 
======== Scenario: for_gnomeworg1 ========
Session Sequence: 
----- Session:  -----
Synopsis: A worg stands guard along with a band of goblins while they torment a captive deep gnome. If the player gets too close or interferes, the worg turns hostile. An exception is if the player is a drow - then the worg is cowed and servile.

Worg: Away! Speak to Fezzerk. || [context] NodeContext: Fez-erk

======== Scenario: for_owlbear ========
Session Sequence: PAD_HealedOwlbear -> AD_HatchedEgg -> VB_EnterCave -> VB_CubResolution_2P
----- Session: PAD_HealedOwlbear -----
Synopsis: A short VB after player heals the Owlbear in gameplay. Owlbear is still dangerous, though. This can happen either before or after the player has interacted with Owlbear. It's meant to give feedback on the fact that the owlbear is now healed, but not to encourage the player to provoke her.

Player: Healed - but she doesn't look much happier. || [context] NodeContext: Karlach: 'I healed you, owlbear--> you still look like you're gonna rip my face off.'

----- Session: AD_HatchedEgg -----
Synopsis: The party reacts to coming across some large empty eggshells, from an owlbear. They may recognise the species, or may have already picked up an intact egg.

Player: Owlbear eggshells... an unhatched one would fetch quite a price... || [context] NodeContext: Speaking from knowledge or experience. The player recognises the egg they've spotted and the price that an intact one could fetch.

Turning his attention to the player to deliver a threat.
Player: I'm not looking for trouble - just want to pass by.
Fezzerk: Heh, funny. That's what our birdie wanted. || [context] NodeContext: Mocking. Refers to the player's previous statement ('I don't want trouble - just want to pass by').

(A ridiculously high sum - questionable whether he truly knows how absurd a demand this is)
Narrator: *A strange symbol glows, marked on their flesh, and something within you stirs in response.*

----- Session: DragonEvent -----
Synopsis: A Flaming Fist detachment tries to confront a githyanki war band. The Flaming Fists are completely outmatched, however; the githyanki warriors dismiss their demands.

Ellyka: Hrast, another one! Keep back, flatface - I know how to handle myself! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Ellyka is immediately defensive, brandishing a dagger at the gith player.NodeContext: Hrast pronounced hur-RAST-ing. Similar to damn/fuck in common language.
Player: Take it easy, I'm only disguised as a gith.
Ellyka: What? Why...? Never mind. I don't want to know.
Ellyka: So... you not looking to make trouble for me, are you? Whatever you are?
Player: I didn't say that... || [approval] ['Astarion 1', 'Shadowheart -1', 'Wyll -1', 'Karlach -1']
Ellyka: That's how you want it... fine.
Ellyka: You're not like that lot at the bridge. I reckon I can handler you... come on!

----- Session: AD_ScoutReactsToDragon -----
Synopsis: A tiefling refugee observes a war party of githyanki warriors guarding a bottleneck in the main road leading out of the region. The githyanki are alien and fearsome to the tiefling. She reacts with shock when she sees how they have a dragon circling overhead in support.

Ellyka: Helm protect me, where'd that beast come from...? || [context] NodeContext: A tiefling refugee reacts with terror and awe upon seeing a dragon fly overhead.

----- Session: ConfrontationLaezel -----
Synopsis: Alternate version of the dragon rider scene at chokepoint. Lae'zel is alive and was never recruited. Player can recruit her after this.

Lae'zel approaches the rider to discover where to find the creche. A cure for the tadpole can be found there - or so she believes. However, the knight is under different orders.

Narrator: *Your skull pounds in response to the githyanki's white-hot stare. Her lips don't move, yet you hear her voice.*
Lae'zel: You. Stay put, and keep your lips sealed.
Lae'zel: Rider - my time is short. Lead me to... || [context] NodeContext: Lae'zel begins to bow as she speaks to the kith'rak
Kith'rak Voss: Sh-sh-shh. Such a familiar tone.
Kith'rak Voss: Were I not merciful, I would slice the skin clean from your meat.

Kith'rak Voss: Your name, child.
Player: If you wish to speak, speak to me. || [approval] ["Lae'zel -5", 'Shadowheart 1', 'Karlach -1']
Lae'zel: Imbecile. Stay back! || [context] NodeContext: Lae'zel looks up from bowing at the player in anger

----- Session: CINE_RiderAndDragonLeave -----
Synopsis: Cinematic: Kith'rak Voss flies away on his dragon.The player interrupted the Gith Chokepoint situation. The most likely interruption is triggering a combat (player attacks any npc there including Voss or the dragon, or drags another hostile npc near them)This interruption happens in gameplay, so normally the Rider (Kith'rak Voss) and the Dragon would also leave in gameplay, but animations don't have the tech support to make the Rider ride the dragon like this, so we play this cutscene instead

[desc] CinematicNodeContext: ~The dragon spreads its wings and soars away.
NOTE: this could be used in a number of circumstances in which Voss flies away. Voss is an arrogant senior gith officer, focused on his mission, so he can always depart while being unfazed by preceeding events. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: ~The dragon spreads its wings and soars away.
NOTE: this could be used in a number of circumstances in which Voss flies away. Voss is an arrogant senior gith officer, focused on his mission, so he can always depart while being unfazed by preceeding events.

----- Session: Confrontation -----
Synopsis: Our party encounters a band of githyanki warriors who have taken position at bottleneck in the region - a bridge that provides one of the few paths of progression. The gith confront us and try to see if we know anything about the 'weapon' they seek. (The weapon in question is the strange puzzle box we are carrying.) While reading our thoughts, the githyanki may realise we are tadpoled, resulting in instant combat. If we manage to conceal our tadpoles, they may allow us to pass.

Kith'rak Voss: What easy prey you make, walking right within my blade's embrace.
Kith'rak Voss: You are unknown to me, kin. Are you straight from the crèche, wandering unbidden? || [context] InternalNodeContext: Do not put a selection speaker here, gith has priority
Kith'rak Voss: Explain yourself, vin'iisk. || [context] NodeContext: Vin'iisk - 'underling'. Pronounced 'Vin-ISK'.
Player: Impersonate a fierce gith and refuse him any explanation.
: False
Kith'rak Voss: There is no conviction in your voice. What are you? A deserter? A traitor?

----- Session: AD_StandOff -----
Synopsis: A flaming fist solider nervously attempts to challenge a githyanki warrior. The gith is essentially an alien to the lowly soldier; he can't help but feel intimidated.

Sarth Baretha: Your babbling tires me, istik. Move your carcass! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Authoritative demandingNodeContext: Authoritative demanding. 'istik' =  'Stranger' - Catch-all term for non-gith. Pronounced Iss-tick
Gauntlet Dion: B-by order of the Flaming Fist, halt! || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Unintelligent confusionNodeContext: Unintelligent confusion
Sarth Baretha: Or what? Show us what you can do, worm. || [context] NodeContext: Htak'-a meaning "Die!" in gith language

Narrator: *Magical energy courses through the slate. You are flooded with understanding.*
Narrator: *A mystical map glows before you, revealing a githyanki refuge inside a temple within the mountain pass.*

Synopsis: Salazon is preparing a fire-trap at the entrance to his gang's hideout. We can either sneak up on him or be sneaked up on in turn - either way we have to convince him we should be there or he'll get skittish and blow us all up. In general he's jumpy and suspicious of us, but relieved when we convince him we're a friend. Think an inexperienced guard pointing a gun at us when he's been told to be on alert.

Player: Wait!
Player: Wait - listen!

--- Scenario Details ---
======== Scenario: hag_hag ========
Session Sequence: PAD_TadpoleDivine
----- Session: PAD_TadpoleDivine -----
Synopsis: This VB plays after attempting to get Ethel to remove the tadpole. She confesses that there's something special about it and she can't remove it.Will play on the player who leaves the dialog that reveals this fact, but characters can be fairly opinionated here since they are reacting to knowledge.Up to two characters.

Player: The tadpole was tampered with? That complicates things...
Player: Tampered or not, we need to get these things out of our heads. Let's find another way.

You tell the Hunter where your camp is, the Hunter says he'll take Astarion during the night the next time you go to sleep, then the dialog ends and this PAD plays.Your companion reacts to your decision to hand Astarion over (speaker 2) and then you clarify/justify your decision (speaker 1)

Player: You gave him up? I wasn't sure you would.
Player: He's too dangerous to have around. We'd always be sleeping with one eye open.

The player can also abandon them to their fates.

Demir: Bloody hells, she just disappeared. Ain't seen nothing like that before. || [context] NodeContext: Opening line of the dialogue, The hag has vanished and your left terrified. This monster has your sister and the sheer magnitude of the situation is hitting you.
Johl: She could shoot fireworks out of her backside for all I care; the hag has Rina. || [context] NodeContext: Your brother is afraid of the hag and you're having none of it. The hag has your sister and you'd fight a thousand of those monsters to save Mayrina - you're pissed that your brother isn't the same.
Player: Will someone please tell me what's going on?
Demir: It's our sister - Mayrina. She is... well, she was in a bad way after her husband died. || [context] NodeContext: Your sister is heavily pregnant and has disappeared - likely to make a deal with a monster - in the hopes of bringing her husband back. Your voice is gentle as you discuss the trauma Mayrina has gone through - obvious that you love her and are worried about her.
Johl: Started saying weird things, like how she was gonna bring him back. || [context] NodeContext: Your sister is heavily pregnant and has disappeared - likely to make a deal with a monster - in the hopes of bringing her husband back. You're scared but are hiding it beneath anger and frustration.
Demir: Next thing, she's gone looking for the hag. Of all the stupid things to do. || [context] NodeContext: You're terrified for your sister and her child and are struggling to justify her reasons for disappearing. You think she's being foolish and naive.
Demir: We haven't seen her since, and no good ever came from dealing with a hag. || [context] NodeContext: Ibid.
Johl: None of this matters, all right? We need to get her back. And fast. || [context] NodeContext: Your brother keeps talking and you're getting more angry and scared. You need to leave and find your sister - you're terrified of what will happen if you don't.
Player: You're on your own. I have enough problems. || [approval] ['Astarion 1', "Lae'zel 1", 'Shadowheart 5', 'Wyll -1']
Johl: And we've no need of a mouthy bastard.

Annoyed as you plead with the two men who advance on you. You sound sincere and genuine.
Johl: Drop the act, hag. You was the last to see Mayrina. || [context] NodeContext: Not buying Auntie Ethel's claim that she hasn't seen Mayrina. Accusation and fury in your voice - you're prepared to get violent if needs be.
Demir: Just let her go. Please. || [context] NodeContext: Your brother is on the brink of violence and you're trying to regain control of the situation. You just want your baby sister back, you don't want anyone to get hurt.
: You there! Please, I don't know what's come over these boys. I just want to go home. || [context] NodeContext: You've caught sight of the player. You call out, fear and pleading in your voice - in your mind you've hatched a plan - you're going to force the player to defend you and kill the brothers.
