Ketheric Thorm: He could not break. His daughter needed him whole, after all.
Ketheric Thorm: She grew up - grew strong. Challenged him. Filled his heart with such joy it supplanted all sorrow.
Ketheric Thorm: When she was killed, the man... he tried to remain whole, but it wasn't possible. Do you understand?
Player: So the man fell to pieces.
Ketheric Thorm: The pain was unbearable. All-consuming. He decided he'd do anything for reprieve.
Ketheric Thorm: First, he sold himself to the goddess of loss. But the pain did not subside, no matter his obscene feats of devotion.
Ketheric Thorm: Then a new god came - a god who promised the man something wonderful: his daughter. Her life returned. Imagine it.
Ketheric Thorm: He would have to give everything: his body and soul entire. He did not hesitate. Not for a moment.
Ketheric Thorm: And the new god did as promised. The man's brilliant, beautiful daughter came back. She was whole - she was alive. But she despised the pitiful wretch her father had become.
Ketheric Thorm: Her hatred he could bear, perhaps, as long as she had another chance to live.
Ketheric Thorm: Everything I've done, everything I have built, has been to give Isobel that chance. And you, True Soul - you have squandered it.
Player: You brought her back once. Do it again.
Ketheric Thorm: I can. I will. But it is not without cost. Who will pay this time, True Soul?
Ketheric Thorm: I have no mercy left in me - but it is for the Absolute to decide your fate. || [context] NodeContext: Almost sarcastic, like a very annoyed child talking to their parent
Ketheric Thorm: Kneel at the altar. Now.

----- Session: RoofCultist -----
Susdera: You have already been told.
Susdera: You will turn around. Should the General learn you breached his private chapel, he will not be so merciful. || [context] NodeContext: The fact that we might refuse doesn't even enter her mind
Player: Do not come between a True Soul and the Absolute.
Susdera: Do you think yourself so important, True Soul? Until Z'rell says otherwise, you are beneath the Absolute's notice. || [context] NodeContext: Amused - we don't even know how little we are in her eyes

Linsella: Clean up your mess, Timothy. That gnome was not for eating. || [context] NodeContext: Chiding
'Timothy': *Whine*.
Linsella: Oh, my love. Did you think it was me? I'm a halfling, you great furry fool. || [context] NodeContext: Realizing that Timothy was actually trying to kill her when he ate a gnome. Not angry, just amused.

Narrator: *A ritual circle. Judging by the shadow sigils inscribed, it was used in the creation of Balthazar's Moonlanterns.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: A shot of the sigil on the desk. It looks dark, evil, unsettling...
Narrator: *Though its power is weakened, you could still use the shattered pixies Balthazar discarded to craft one final lantern - not to repel the shadows, but to wield them.*
Narrator: *Mystra forbids the use of such magic. She would insist the sigils be destroyed, the circle's evil dissipated. But she is not here, and you are.*
Player: Erase the shadow sigils.
Narrator: *It doesn't take much. The sigils fade, the circle's tainted magic dissolving harmlessly into the ether.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The player reaches out confidently towards the sigil, focused on its destruction. The sigil flares briefly, then fades. It's extinguished.
Narrator: *For the briefest moment, you feel the touch of a reassuring hand on your shoulder. Mystra has noted your service.* || [context] CinematicNodeContext: Gale smiles to himself - a job well done

----- Session: PAD_SharranObservation -----
Shadowheart: There is nothing Sharran about this man. He has betrayed the Dark Lady. || [context] NodeContext: Quiet anger and disgust.

----- Session: Zhent02 -----
Yerle: Ain't looking to convert, True Soul. Gods mind their mess, I mind mine. || [context] NodeContext: Respectful but flat refusal - most Absolutists want to convert others, and she's pre-empting it.

----- Session: BazEntranceGuard -----
Acolyte Belub: Each pack of 'recruits' they bring in is worse than the last. || [context] InternalNodeContext: Belub is not impressed by the new pilgrims who have shown up to join the Absolutes cause.
Acolyte Belub: Can't trust them to sweep the stables, let alone swing a sword.
Player: They have potential. Great warriors have grown from less.<br>
Acolyte Belub: Aye, and better fighters than them've been fertiliser on the fields too.
Acolyte Belub: We'd be better off without 'em, take my word.

----- Session: AD_BugbearThrow -----
Lann Tarv: I could hit a pixie from a hundred paces. || [context] NodeContext: congratulating himself on a well-thrown axe, while practicing

----- Session: BazaarStander_006 -----
Pilgrim Nalira: The prisoners below are gone, True Soul. I cannot understand why they would flee Her mercy. || [context] InternalNodeContext: The prisoners successfully escaped from Moonrise's dungeons (perhaps all, perhaps only one)NodeContext: Confused, hurt - prisoners in the cell escaped - she saw them as heathens her church was trying to 'save'

----- Session: BazaarStander_007 -----
Pilgrim Taima: I hear you've been summoned for an audience with Her. You will return changed, I'm sure of it. || [context] InternalNodeContext: The player has kidnapped Isobel and helped return Nightsong and Balthazar to Moonrise. The army of the Absolute is ready to march.NodeContext: Wishing us well - we're about to get our 'reward'

----- Session: Guard01 -----
Adept Furek: You should go through the main hall. Witnessing the General's justice is an honour.

----- Session: Bystander01 -----
Brawler Weneg: Heard a rumour some do-gooder stopped a horde of Absolutists from getting their hands on a load of druids in some grove.
Brawler Weneg: Whoever it was better pray the General doesn't smoke 'em out. Be a bloodbath, so it would.

----- Session: Bystander00 -----
Brawler Orik: You're the best True Soul I ever met.

----- Session: Guard00 -----
Adept Dorikel: I saw it, True Soul. The army. They're nearly ready. It's nearly time.
Player: What role will you take?
Adept Dorikel: I'm trained as an assassin. House Hekar. Perhaps I can serve as a scout - or special operations.
Adept Dorikel: When the call comes, I'll be ready.

----- Session: AD_GoblinsListening -----
Brawler Weneg: Enough! Just leave the bloody True Souls to their business.
Brawler Wim: And what's to say that couldn't be us? They say the General rewards them as serve him well.
Brawler Orik: And what about them who hang around his door like a bad smell?

----- Session: AD_BazEntranceGuard_002 -----
Zealot Brinn: Another True Soul. The Disciple will want to see you - through the main doors.

----- Session: AD_Minthara_BazaarEntry -----
Nightwarden Minthara: Converts, pilgrims, mercenaries. They all seek power, but will find only death.

----- Session: Bystander02 -----
Brawler Wim: We ought to head out now - burn everything between here and the city.

----- Session: AD_GoblinsAfterExecution -----
Brawler Orik: They bloody killed 'em. What now? Are we next? || [context] NodeContext: stunned, fearful
Brawler Wim: Not if you keep them lips clapped together. || [context] NodeContext: Low and urgent - hushing loud comrade.
Brawler Weneg: Quiet, both of yas! Ye're drawin' attention. || [context] NodeContext: Hissed in anger

----- Session: AD_ZhentarimCrew -----
Roah Moonglow: Smile, Yerle. We're among friends. || [context] NodeContext: Half-mocking, half-prodding. Her dour bodyguards are looking around at cultists suspiciously
Yerle: Too damn friendly, you ask me. Gods-fearing folk ought to be more... fearful. || [context] NodeContext: The cultists bother her - they're too friendly, too faithful. It's not right.
Roah Moonglow: Why not join this Absolute, see what all the fuss is about? || [context] NodeContext: Smirking
Yerle: ...I'll stick with the monster I know, thanks. || [context] NodeContext: Wry, knows she's being mocked  - she's referring to her boss, who she knows is tougher than any cultist of the Absolute

----- Session: BazaarStander_005 -----
Pilgrim Farimorn: Blessings, True Soul. We're to march soon - thanks to you. || [context] InternalNodeContext: The player has kidnapped Isobel and helped return Nightsong and Balthazar to Moonrise. The army of the Absolute is ready to march.NodeContext: Awed by you

----- Session: Bystander04 -----

----- Session: Executioner -----
Disciple Z'rell: It was you. You destroyed the Nightsong.
Disciple Z'rell: How could you do this to us? To Ketheric? To the Absolute?
Disciple Z'rell: You've turned your back on our Chosen in the most heinous way. And our retribution will be terrible.

----- Session: CrestfallenHound_SwA -----
Squire: That scent - the Selûnite magic on your skin - it fills this place.

Ketheric Thorm: My Lord beckons me. || [context] NodeContext: Breathing is ragged, he's in bad shape.
Ketheric Thorm: You have no idea what you're meddling with. You're a pawn - a slave - to forces you cannot comprehend.
Ketheric Thorm: I am the Chosen, and you are nothing. Follow. See. || [context] CinematicNodeContext: The tentacle zaps him away, leaving a crevice through which the player can follow.

Fist Nipawa: Watching gods. These poor bastards actually die believing. || [context] NodeContext: Vague disbelief, regret - they're killing people who believe in a nonsense god.

Player: Actually, Jaheira, why don't you join me? || [approval] ['Karlach 5']
Jaheira: Good question.
Jaheira: I can't quite put my finger on why I trust you, but I do: the same instinct through which I know a wolf will bite, or allow itself to be petted.
Jaheira: You'll bite. But not me. Not as long as we run in the same pack.
Player: Better we fight separately. || [approval] ['Karlach -5']
