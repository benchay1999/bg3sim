=== Session: AD_BanditsDiscussion ===
Synopsis: Discussion between Gimbleboc and Taman before the scene against them triggers. They're arguing about whether to investigate the crash (this segues into the beginning of their intertactive dialogue when you get near enough)

=== Session: AD_Bandit_Caster_01_CrushedReaction ===
Synopsis: A bandit reacts to finding one of her companions dead in an apparent accident. She looks on the bright side.

Quelenna: Well, that's one less greedy bastard to share the loot with. || [context] NodeContext: with a shrug - found a dead companion and sees the bright side

=== Session: VB_LockpickingShadowheart_1_WithShadowheart ===
Synopsis: Shadowheart lockpicked the crypt door that she usually try to bash.

Shadowheart: There! Not so impregnable after all. || [context] NodeContext: Satisfied. She's just successfully lockpicked a large, heavy set of doors.

=== Session: VB_BanditsLeaveReaction ===

=== Session: AD_Bandit_Ranger_01_CrushedReaction ===
Synopsis: A bandit reacts to the corpse of a dead companion, crushed by a falling boulder

Warryn: Gods. Look at that. || [context] NodeContext: sees the corpse of a friend, crushed by a boulder. Assumes it's an accident. More complaining than sad.

=== Session: AD_Bandit_Melee_01_CrushedReaction ===
Synopsis: A bandit sees one of his friends crushed (dead) by a boulder and doesn't have a great deal of sympathy

Gimblebock: How the hells did that happen?! || [context] NodeContext: seeing a companion crushed by a boulder - he thinks it was an accident but is unnerved

=== Session: VB_Fissure_1 ===
Synopsis: The player notices a gap in the flooring of an ancient chapel. There's faint signs of something else below.

Player: There's something underneath here...
