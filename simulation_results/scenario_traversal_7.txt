=== Session: AD_Bandit_Caster_01_CrushedReaction ===
Synopsis: A bandit reacts to finding one of her companions dead in an apparent accident. She looks on the bright side.

Quelenna: Well, that's one less greedy bastard to share the loot with. || [context] NodeContext: with a shrug - found a dead companion and sees the bright side

=== Session: EntranceDoor ===
Synopsis: This is the same character as Andorn, the bandit guard within the chapel.

This character is talking to the players through a door - he's locked the door and is on the other side, so they'll be talking TO the door and can't see him.

The player is talking to a gullible bandit through a door - the bandit is inside a chapel dungeon and his friends are outside. The player has probably either killed them or scared them away at this point. The guard is not very bright...

GROUP_Act1_CHA_FL1_BanditGuard: That you, Gimblebock? Everything all right out there? || [context] NodeContext: Speaking to players through a locked door. He's reacting to them trying to open it and thinks they're his accomplice, a gnome called Gimblebock (ɡɪmbəl-bock)
Player: Yes, it's me. Lemme in!
: True
GROUP_Act1_CHA_FL1_BanditGuard: You sound a bit shaken, boss. Hang on while I find the key... || [context] NodeContext: Speaking to players through a locked door. Player just claimed to be his 'boss' - a  bandit leader - and he's going to unlock the door to let them in

=== Session: VB_LockpickingCrypt_1_WithShadowheart ===
Synopsis: The player lockpicked the crypt door that shadowheart was trying to bash.

Shadowheart: What, you got it open, just like that...? || [context] NodeContext: A little incredulous/exasperated: she's just witnessed someone easily open a door that she's been trying to break down the last while.

=== Session: VB_BanditsLeaveReaction ===
Synopsis: The player comments on how they talked the bandits into leaving (or companions react to the player's successful persuasion).

Player: Lucky those bandits valued their own hides over their loot.

=== Session: AD_Bandit_Ranger_01_CrushedReaction ===
Synopsis: A bandit reacts to the corpse of a dead companion, crushed by a falling boulder

Warryn: Gods. Look at that. || [context] NodeContext: sees the corpse of a friend, crushed by a boulder. Assumes it's an accident. More complaining than sad.

=== Session: AD_Bandit_Melee_01_CrushedReaction ===
Synopsis: A bandit sees one of his friends crushed (dead) by a boulder and doesn't have a great deal of sympathy

Gimblebock: How the hells did that happen?! || [context] NodeContext: seeing a companion crushed by a boulder - he thinks it was an accident but is unnerved

=== Session: Bandit_Melee_01_Dead ===
Synopsis: Speak with Dead dialogue with Gimblebock - the leader of the bandits who're looting the ruined chapel near where the player first wakes up. Gimblebock's answers are fragmented, cryptic. He can only draw on info that he knew when he was alive, and will refuse to speak to his killer if he recognises them. After a maximum of five questions, he'll fall silent for good.

Narrator: *The corpse regards you lifelessly.*
Player: Who was this chapel dedicated to?
Narrator: *The corpse remains silent. It does not know.*
